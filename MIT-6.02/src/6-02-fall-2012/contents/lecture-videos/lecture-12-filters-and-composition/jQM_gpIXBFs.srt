8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,910
PROFESSOR: So we're
going to continue

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,360
talking about LTI systems
and how to work with them.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,290
We're thinking of an LTI
model for a channel, something

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,540
with input xn, output yn.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,910
And we've seen
that the output can

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,430
be obtained from the input
through this convolution

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,300
operation, right?

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,230
So for instance, this
was one way to write it.

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,810
And the shorthand notation
here was h star x,

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,930
evaluate to the time n.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,500
The m here, in general,
goes from minus infinity

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,010
to plus infinity.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,980
In general, you put a unit
sample function of the input,

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,930
the response can extend
from minus infinity

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,870
to infinity if you've
got a non-causal system.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,690
If you've got a causal system
and you put a unit sample in,

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,690
then the response starts from
0 and goes on to the future.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,760
But it's often useful to be
able to represent and analyze

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,900
non-causal systems.

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,780
I mean, if you have all the
data stored in your computer,

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,975
then you can look forward
and back from the time

29
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:44,600
that you're at.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,430
And therefore, you
can do things that

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,500
can be looked at as non-causal
or analyzed as non-causal.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,080
Now, there's one issue
that we've kind of swept

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,700
under the rug, which is you can
write nice looking formulas,

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,840
but do they mean anything?

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,360
So we went through a
plausible derivation,

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,950
but if you end up
with a summation

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,870
from minus infinity to
infinity, then you've

38
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,020
got to ask yourself when
does this make sense?

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,810
Because you know that adding
an infinite number of things

40
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,050
can cause problems.

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,270
So you need conditions for
all of this to make sense.

42
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,918
For instance, if h was 1 for all
time and x was 1 for all time,

43
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,710
there's no way this is
going to make sense.

44
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,250
Because it's going to blow up
at every value of n, right?

45
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,010
So you clearly need conditions.

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:35,780
So what we're looking for is
conditions for convolution

47
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,595
to be well behaved.

48
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,560
And I'm going to give you
one important condition.

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,600
Well actually, let
me give you two.

50
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,680
So here's one.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,890
Suppose we have a causal
system and input that

52
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:16,280
starts from 0 at time 0.

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,610
When I say starts out, I
mean that for all prior times

54
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,050
the input is 0.

55
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,360
So we've got an input that
is 0 for all negative times.

56
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:35,300
And then, at n equals 0 we
start to get some action, OK?

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,050
So let's see, what happens
to this infinite sum

58
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,340
in this particular case?

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,210
If I have a causal system,
that means that h of n

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,310
is 0 for n less than 0, right?

61
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,060
That's what you should
think of right away

62
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,220
when you're told a
system is causal.

63
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,340
The unit sample response can
only extend from 0 onwards.

64
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,950
So if the unit sample response
is 0 for a negative time,

65
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,530
and the input starts at
time 0, what simplifications

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,130
can you make to that
convolution representation?

67
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,760
Somebody?

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,572
Yeah.

69
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:26,660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

70
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,100
PROFESSOR: 0 to
infinity does it?

71
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,785
OK, so the answer
was that instead

72
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,410
of starting at minus
infinity, you only

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,205
need to start the
summation at m equals 0.

74
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,580
Because the h of
m is going to be

75
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,590
0 for all negative values of m.

76
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,495
So you can start
that summation at 0.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,740
And then, where
does the summation--

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,494
where can the summation end?

79
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,490
AUDIENCE: n?

80
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,160
PROFESSOR: n?

81
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,500
Yeah, because this x here
is 0 for negative values

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,910
of the argument.

83
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,220
Negative values of the argument
are values of m greater than n.

84
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,027
So this only needs to
extend over a finite region.

85
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,110
Well, if you have a finite
sum, then you're happy.

86
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,670
Nothing's going to blow up.

87
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,410
So this is certainly one case
where everything works fine.

88
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,780
There's another case
which I'll describe

89
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:24,260
which is where your
input is bounded

90
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,790
and what we mean by
that is that your xn has

91
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,820
an absolute value
that's less than

92
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,520
or equal to some maximum value--

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,770
some finite maximum
value for all time.

94
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,270
So no matter what
n you pick, you're

95
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,610
always within this interval, OK?

96
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:47,290
So your input is, here's
your n, here's your plus m,

97
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,730
here's your minus m.

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,640
And your input is
constrained for all time

99
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,280
to just lie between
these limits.

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,830
So that's a bounded input.

101
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,620
And here's the other
part of the condition.

102
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:11,680
Absolute value of hm summed
over all m is finite.

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,509
We say that h is
absolutely summable--

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,170
absolutely summable.

105
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,060
So what does that do for us?

106
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,390
Well, it actually allows
us to bound the outputs.

107
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,370
So now, it turns
out y of n, that's

108
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,130
the absolute value
of the output.

109
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,880
Well, that's less than or
equal to the absolute value

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:01,220
of this convolution
expression, which

111
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,640
is in turn less than-- well,
it's equal to that, right?

112
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,955
It's equal to that, but it's
less than or equal to this.

113
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,440
Absolute value of
a sum is less than

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
or equal to the sum of
the absolute values.

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,020
And that's less than
or equal to capital M--

116
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,320
this is the max value
that we allowed up there--

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,950
times summation hm.

118
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,540
So this whole thing is finite.

119
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,635
So basically, you
can bound the output.

120
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,010
You can guarantee
that the output

121
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,860
is bounded provided these
two conditions are satisfied.

122
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,100
So this is actually a very
important pair of conditions.

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,535
It's one that we encounter
all the time and in practice.

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,580
And because of this
result, we actually

125
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,550
refer to an LTI
system that satisfies

126
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,370
this absolute
solvability condition.

127
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:18,300
We say that the LTI
system is bounded

128
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,950
input, bounded output stable--

129
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,450
bounded input,
bounded output stable.

130
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,770
And I've run out of space
from my stable there.

131
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,400
So if somebody tells you
they have a bounded input,

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,580
bounded output stable system,
if we're talking about an LTI

133
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,390
system, what they mean is that
that condition is satisfied.

134
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,520
So that's an
important condition.

135
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,390
OK, I have all that on a slide.

136
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:09,480
But if I race it past you on a
slide, then it's hard to track.

137
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
But this is something
that we want to do.

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,470
So for instance, if I had an
LTI system whose unit sample

139
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,040
response was the following--

140
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:29,940
let's say it's 0 for all times
up to and including time 0,

141
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:41,160
and then it takes the value
1 over n, from then on, OK?

142
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,060
So let's see, one
way to write this

143
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,980
is 1 over n u of n minus 1.

144
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,990
If I tell you that
the h of n is this,

145
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,470
that automatically takes care
of zeroing out everything

146
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,310
from 0 backwards, and then
putting in 1 over n from then

147
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,210
on.

148
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,840
So is that BIBO stable system--

149
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,630
bounded input,
bounded output stable?

150
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,250
Yes?

151
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,450
How many think yes?

152
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,060
You'd like to think it's
stable, because a unit sample

153
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,350
response is decaying.

154
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,160
But actually, it doesn't
satisfy the absolute solvability

155
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,090
condition.

156
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,060
The sum of 1 over n
from 1 to infinity is--

157
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,350
it actually blows up.

158
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,670
It doesn't converge.

159
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,450
If it falls off any
faster than that,

160
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,750
then you're in good shape.

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,610
But this is actually bad.

162
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,390
If you had something that
was 1 over n squared--

163
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,330
OK, so this is not BIBO stable.

164
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,890
But if you had 1 over n
squared u of n minus 1,

165
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,270
it is BIBO stable.

166
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:59,820
If you had, let's say, 1/3
to the n u of n minus-- well,

167
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,770
we'll say u of n,
that's BIBO stable.

168
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,780
So this falls off
as 1 over n squared.

169
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,060
That's fast enough for
the sum to converge.

170
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,790
This falls off
exponentially faster.

171
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,480
It's as a geometric series.

172
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,530
It's a discrete
time exponential.

173
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,750
So that's fast enough.

174
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,160
So that's also BIBO stable.

175
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,190
All right, so this
is time domain.

176
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,270
We know how to analyze
any LTI system with this.

177
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,180
You tell me what the
unit sample response is

178
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,510
and I can tell you what the
output is for any given input.

179
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,980
But this would be a nightmare if
we had to do design with this,

180
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,776
because convolution is not--

181
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,390
it's simple enough to implement
for a particular case,

182
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,200
but it's not a simple
operation to think in terms of.

183
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,620
The reason is that the
output at any one time

184
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,640
is obtained by scrambling
all the inputs for all time,

185
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,177
combining them in this
weighted linear fashion.

186
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,010
And then, if you move
to the next time step,

187
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,902
you're again scrambling all the
inputs, but with the weights

188
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,360
shifted a little
bit, so you've got

189
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,340
to start from scratch again.

190
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,300
So it's very hard to know
what you can say in general

191
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,410
using the time domain.

192
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,480
It's not clear at
all how you'll do

193
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,440
design, for instance, of filters
to filter out noise and so on.

194
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
So this is actually--

195
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,800
it's important.

196
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,620
It's a full characterisation
of LTI systems.

197
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,210
But if we had to
stop there, it's

198
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,080
a fair bet that we wouldn't
be anywhere near where

199
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,180
we are for engineered
systems, certainly

200
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,340
not in digital communication.

201
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,950
So the key thing is
actually to start thinking

202
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,650
in terms of frequencies.

203
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,150
So we're going to
look-- we're going

204
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,400
to spend the next
several lectures looking

205
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,410
at the frequency domain.

206
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,770
And so what is the
frequency domain?

207
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,160
Well, we're going to be
focusing, essentially,

208
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,300
on sinusoidal inputs and inputs
that are related to them.

209
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,780
But let me actually just start
back with something simpler.

210
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,787
Here's my question.

211
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,870
And I hope the answer isn't
already on the slides.

212
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,440
Maybe it is.

213
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,830
Is it true that if my input
was periodic-- so for instance,

214
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,930
if I had an input that,
let's say, did this,

215
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:33,450
it ramped up over
maybe four time steps,

216
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,260
and then started again,
ramping up over 4 times steps,

217
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,172
and continued that indefinitely.

218
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,850
So here's my x of n.

219
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,100
It's an x of n that has
some basic period that

220
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,110
then repeats periodically.

221
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,430
So it satisfies
that condition xn

222
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,320
equals xn plus capital P
for some number capital P

223
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,070
that's the period.

224
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,600
What is capital P in this case?

225
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,890
4?

226
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,570
OK.

227
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,370
So every 4, this repeats.

228
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,940
Is it true that if I had a
periodic input to an LTI system

229
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,630
that I'll get a periodic output?

230
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,220
Any reason I should expect that?

231
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,090
Yeah?

232
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,435
AUDIENCE: Depends on the system.

233
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,060
PROFESSOR: Could you
speak up a little?

234
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,440
AUDIENCE: It depends
on the system.

235
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,320
PROFESSOR: It depends
on the system.

236
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,180
I'm telling you it's
LTI but nothing more.

237
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,110
So it depends on which
particular LTI system?

238
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,490
That would be my intuition, too.

239
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,100
Yeah?

240
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,230
AUDIENCE: Just like
in the piece that it

241
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,025
can average over a long
enough time sample,

242
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:47,340
to where it would be constant.

243
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,600
So I'm assuming it's constant.

244
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,310
PROFESSOR: Well, but
that's an average.

245
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,060
That's one number.

246
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,520
What I'm asking you is could
this output as a function

247
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
of time also be periodic?

248
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,470
Can you guarantee it?

249
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,970
Yeah?

250
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,358
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

251
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,460
PROFESSOR: I'm not
exactly understanding

252
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,210
your prescription.

253
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,600
So are you telling me how
to prove that yn equals

254
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,510
yn plus something for all n?

255
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,620
AUDIENCE: If we
choose enough-- if we

256
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,500
take enough x's can
we make y constant?

257
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,270
PROFESSOR: According to this--

258
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,160
well, I raised the
convolution expression.

259
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,460
But the convolution
expression requires

260
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,090
us to take x's from minus
infinity to plus infinity.

261
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,430
In general, the output at time
n depends on all the inputs.

262
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,060
So it's not clear how
you can block things off.

263
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,380
You had another idea?

264
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:50,410
AUDIENCE: Well, because it's
time invariant, [INAUDIBLE]

265
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,630
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

266
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,610
This is a time
invariant system, right?

267
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,180
So if I shifted the
input by capital P,

268
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,060
the output should also
get shifted by capital P.

269
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,590
But shifting the
input by capital

270
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,030
P gives me the same
input back again.

271
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,270
So the response that I
get for that shifted input

272
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,280
must be the old
response that I had,

273
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,810
which tells me that
the output also

274
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,450
has the property that if
I shifted by capital P,

275
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,430
I'd get the same thing again.

276
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,640
So this is guaranteed
to be period capital P.

277
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,160
Now, actually there's
a little twist to that.

278
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Because we usually
think of the period

279
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,940
as being the smallest interval
for which you can repeat.

280
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,100
It's conceivable that this
output has a smaller interval,

281
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,670
and therefore that the
period is some integer

282
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,560
fraction of this capital P.
But this is the general idea.

283
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,730
So you see that just knowing
that the system is LTI,

284
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,770
you can already tell
a lot about what

285
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,980
the response will look like.

286
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,230
One of our favorite
periodic inputs--

287
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,920
well, if I asked
you to tell me what

288
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,110
your favorite periodic
input is, what might it be?

289
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,508
Any-- sorry?

290
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:01,550
AUDIENCE: Constant input?

291
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,717
PROFESSOR: Constant is good.

292
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,730
That's periodic.

293
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,400
A little less trivial
than constant?

294
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

295
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,780
PROFESSOR: Sinusoid, right?

296
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,680
So here's the nice
thing about sinusoids.

297
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,589
It turns out, for an LTI
system, if I put in a sinusoid,

298
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,040
not only is the output
periodic with the same period.

299
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,720
It's also a sinusoid.

300
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,710
So that's an even
greater restriction here.

301
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,700
You see, in this
particular case,

302
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,069
I have an input that's periodic.

303
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,527
I'm guaranteed the output is
periodic with the same period.

304
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,090
But the actual shape
of the waveform

305
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,260
can be all messed
up relative to this.

306
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,940
It may have no obvious
visual relationship to this.

307
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,670
But if you have a
sinusoidal input,

308
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:49,580
then it turns out
that more is true.

309
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,190
So it turns out, if you put a
sinusoid in, what you get out

310
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,800
is a sinusoid of
the same frequency.

311
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,880
What might change is the
amplitude of the sinusoid

312
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,590
and the phase angle
on the sinusoid.

313
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,930
But it'll be the same frequency
sinusoid that comes out.

314
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,880
So that's a fairly
dramatic restriction.

315
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,820
And that's actually key to
frequency domain methods.

316
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,930
What it means is we can focus
on what an LTI system does

317
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,330
one frequency at a time.

318
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,940
I'll look to see how it
behaves when I excite it with

319
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,610
a particular value of
this big omega here--

320
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,890
that's the frequency--

321
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,970
look at the response.

322
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,410
I know the response will be
exactly at that frequency.

323
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,250
So all I have to capture is
how much did this input get

324
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,450
scaled by--

325
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,760
in other words, how much did
the amplitude change by--

326
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,720
and how much did the
phase get changed by?

327
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,790
I just need to know
the magnitude and phase

328
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,550
transformation of the
cosine at each frequency.

329
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,430
If I know that, I know
everything about the system.

330
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,960
And it decouples my design.

331
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
It allows me to think
frequency by frequency when

332
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,170
I design with an LTI system.

333
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,180
So this is actually a
great simplification.

334
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,790
One other remark I've
made here, by the way,

335
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,850
it's certainly the case
in continuous time,

336
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,740
if I gave you x of
t equals cosine,

337
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:16,640
let's say, omega 0 t plus
theta, this is always periodic.

338
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:24,950
This is periodic with period
2 pi over little omega--

339
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,180
a little omega 0.

340
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,830
Because any time I increase t
by an integer multiple of this,

341
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,450
I'm going to get
an integer multiple

342
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,730
of 2 pi added into the
argument of the cosine.

343
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,450
So I'll be back where
I started, right?

344
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,340
So this is always periodic.

345
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,840
But with a discrete
time sequence,

346
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,970
you actually have to be
a little more careful.

347
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,805
We can think of some particular
discrete time sequence.

348
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,100
We refer to the omega and
the continuous time case

349
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,420
as the angular frequency
in radians per second.

350
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,945
Here, we're thinking of this
as angular frequency in radians

351
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:08,190
per sample, for instance,
because the thing it multiplies

352
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,690
is n.

353
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,770
But basically, the units
of big omega are angle.

354
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,710
Well it turns out that this
may not be strictly periodic

355
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,620
in the sense that
shifting it by an integer

356
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,480
will get you exactly
the same waveform.

357
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,660
And that's all related to
whether this frequency--

358
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,167
whether 2 pi over
omega-- the thing

359
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,500
that you would like to compute
as a period-- is rational

360
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,580
or not.

361
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,030
It turns out, if 2 pi over
big omega is rational,

362
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,700
then the period is the
numerator of that rational.

363
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,910
But otherwise,
it's not rational.

364
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,190
But you can think of it
as being samples taken

365
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,840
from some periodic quantity.

366
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,297
So there's an underlying
time varying--

367
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,130
sorry, there's an
underlying continuous time

368
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,060
periodic waveform.

369
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,470
And you take samples of it.

370
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,700
And depending on the frequency
of the underlying sinusoid,

371
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,670
the sequence of samples
may be exactly periodic,

372
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,350
or may be close
to it in the sense

373
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,830
that they're samples taken
from a periodic signal.

374
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,640
In either case, actually, we
tend to not fuss about that.

375
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,310
We'll talk about a cosine like
this as a sinusoid of frequency

376
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:21,140
omega radians per sample, and
we'll talk about the period

377
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,450
as being 2 pi over
omega even when

378
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,010
it's not strictly periodic.

379
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,010
So 2 pi over omega is
our notion of period.

380
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,265
So a couple of examples
here, you can--

381
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:39,390
I'll leave you to look
through those on the slides.

382
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,435
But you can easily construct
examples where 2 pi over omega

383
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,790
is rational, and draw a
picture, and convince yourself

384
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,830
that it's actually periodic.

385
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,490
So in this case, for
instance, if big omega--

386
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,520
big omega is whatever
multiplies n,

387
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,440
so it's going to be 3 pi over 4.

388
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,240
3 pi over 4 is big omega.

389
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:08,890
So now, I need to look
at 2 pi over omega.

390
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,970
And so that's equal to 8 over 3.

391
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,520
The numerator of that
is what the period is.

392
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,750
So if you were to
actually sketch this out,

393
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,890
you would find that every
8 samples, it repeats.

394
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,420
Whereas, if you look
at this example,

395
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,440
the thing that multiplies
in is 3 over 4.

396
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,670
So now, the period 2 pi over
omega is 2 pi over 3 over 4.

397
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:38,250
So now we're talking
about 8 pi over 3.

398
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,810
That's not rational.

399
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,420
You're not going to get
a periodic sequence.

400
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,220
But we still refer
to 8 pi over 3

401
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,830
as the period of this
discrete time signal, OK?

402
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,460
Just because it comes from
sampling an underlying

403
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,335
continuous time periodic signal.

404
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:53,460
All right, that's a detail.

405
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,460
I just don't want you to
trip up on that later on.

406
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,130
So here's the basic statement--
what I said earlier.

407
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,420
If you have an LTI system--

408
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,060
by the way, I like to
represent this with an h dot,

409
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,787
so that slipped past there.

410
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:15,370
I think I've talked
about this before.

411
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,800
Let me not spend time on it--

412
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,410
notation, notation.

413
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,830
So if the input is a sinusoid of
some frequency, and amplitude,

414
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,600
and phase, the
output is guaranteed

415
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,830
to be a sinusoid of the
same frequency, potentially

416
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,670
different amplitude
and different phase.

417
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,400
So what I want to do is
establish that for you,

418
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,220
starting with our time domain
characterization, which

419
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,789
is LTI convolution.

420
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,920
It turns out,
actually, sinusoids

421
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,110
are not the only things
that have this property.

422
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,570
In fact, it might be good for
me to show you another example,

423
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,070
too.

424
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:16,030
So let me give you another
example of a waveform

425
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,040
that you can put at the input--

426
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,010
or signal that you can put in
the input to an LTI system,

427
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,343
and it comes out the same shape
despite all the convolution.

428
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:26,260
So here's the example.

429
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,850
Suppose xn is what I think of
as a discrete time exponential.

430
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,880
So this is r to the n
for some real number r.

431
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,730
So maybe-- maybe r is 1/2.

432
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:48,800
So this is-- so this is xn.

433
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,435
It's a discrete
time exponential.

434
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,557
You're used to thinking of
that as a geometric series.

435
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:11,640
But when you're talking
about signals and systems,

436
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,060
you like to think of that as
a discrete time exponential.

437
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,630
It does have an
exponential fall off.

438
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,220
What if that goes
in to this system?

439
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:28,010
Well, the output is
given by this expression

440
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,650
always, for an LTI system.

441
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:37,442
So let's just plug in what x
is, that summation over all m,

442
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:41,600
hm, r to the n minus m.

443
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm just substituting in
this expression for x of n.

444
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,350
The n piece of this doesn't
depend on the summation index.

445
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,200
So I can actually
simplify this further.

446
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,250
And here's what I have.

447
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,360
So look what's happened.

448
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,190
I sent in a discrete
time exponential.

449
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,100
And out comes the same
discrete time exponential,

450
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,070
but scaled by some number.

451
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,930
This is just a number, right?

452
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,910
It's an infinite sum.

453
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,750
It's just a number.

454
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,270
It works out to be a number.

455
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,120
You'll have to look for
conditions under which it's

456
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,290
guaranteed to exist.

457
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:35,320
And certainly, if the
system is BIBO stable, and--

458
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,250
well, if the system is
causal, and the exponential

459
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,810
is decaying, then this
is guaranteed to exist.

460
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,360
OK, so here's an example
of another kind of signal--

461
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,820
related to the
sinusoid as we'll see--

462
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,700
that has the property that you
put it through the LTI system.

463
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,732
Despite all this convolution
stuff that's going on,

464
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:55,440
I don't even have to
know what that h is.

465
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,315
I can tell you right
away that what comes out

466
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,190
is the same
exponential but scaled.

467
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,120
So now, we're going
to try and establish

468
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,460
the property for sinusoids.

469
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,750
And the way to do that--
the efficient way to do that

470
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,820
is actually to work
with exponentials again.

471
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,580
Except they're not exponentials
of the type that I have there.

472
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,367
They're complex exponentials.

473
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:34,580
Now, when you learn complex
numbers in high school,

474
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,160
maybe you thought you wouldn't
have to deal with them again.

475
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,045
And then you came to calculus
and you had complex numbers,

476
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:41,420
and you thought
maybe after that,

477
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,070
you don't have to
deal with them again.

478
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,720
So I'm here to tell
you that you're always

479
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,560
going to have to deal
with complex numbers.

480
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,760
So you have to get
comfortable with them.

481
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,450
So we're talking
about, essentially,

482
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,220
points in the plane--

483
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,470
point with a real part
and an imaginary part.

484
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,005
So here's the complex number c.

485
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,880
Here's the real part.

486
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
Here's the imaginary part.

487
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,910
I never thought I'd
need to define j,

488
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:20,217
but actually, it turns out that
if not everyone in the room

489
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:22,050
is an electrical engineer,
then maybe you're

490
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,200
used to thinking of i as being
the square root of minus 1.

491
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,050
Electrical engineers like
j, because they reserve i

492
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,290
for currents, right?

493
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,570
So j is the square
root of minus 1

494
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,500
in all electrical engineering.

495
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,590
The key identity that you
need is Euler's identity.

496
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:47,820
Let me actually
write it on the board

497
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,250
and leave it there, because
we'll be coming back to it

498
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,150
multiple times.

499
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,450
Well, actually I can
have it on this board,

500
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,658
because it's really the same.

501
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,410
It's really this picture.

502
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,300
e to the j theta is
some complex number.

503
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:25,400
Its real part is cosine
theta, and its imaginary part

504
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,700
is sine theta.

505
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,510
That's all that Euler's
identity is saying, right?

506
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,750
Here's a complex number.

507
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,010
Its real part is cosine
theta, its imaginary part

508
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,680
of sine theta.

509
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,380
So what's the magnitude
of e to the j theta?

510
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,220
Every complex number
has a magnitude.

511
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,260
e to the j theta
has magnitude what?

512
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,060
1.

513
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,270
Because it's cosine squared
plus sine squared, right?

514
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,370
And the angle of
e to the j theta--

515
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,180
the angle of a complex
number is just the angle

516
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,150
from the real axis
up to this vector.

517
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,986
So the angle is?

518
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:20,297
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

519
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:25,110
PROFESSOR: I'm hearing
more complicated answers

520
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,580
than I expected.

521
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Theta, right?

522
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:31,590
You're right.

523
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,960
It's arctan sine theta over cos
theta, which is theta, right?

524
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,120
All right, so this
is Euler's identity.

525
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,517
And this is really critical.

526
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:47,100
And if you can
remember this, then you

527
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,260
can remember all sorts
of other identities

528
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,560
that might trip you
up from time to time.

529
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:02,180
So for instance, let's see,
if I have e to the j theta

530
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:13,070
1 times e to the j theta 2,
does that simplify to this?

531
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,220
That's OK, right?

532
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,450
That's just combining
the exponents.

533
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,910
Well, expand this out
using Euler's identity.

534
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,400
Expand this out using
Euler's identity.

535
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,680
Expand this out using
Euler's identity,

536
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,250
and you discover, for instance,
that cosine theta 1 plus theta

537
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:36,650
2 equals cosine theta 1, cosine
theta 2, minus sine theta

538
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,290
1 sine theta 2.

539
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,910
OK, you know all
these identities.

540
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,390
But if you're ever pressed to
derive them, the place to start

541
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,270
is Euler's identity.

542
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,580
If you're pressed to
derive Euler's identity,

543
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,100
then maybe go back
to Taylor series.

544
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,590
But if you want to carry
one thing in your head,

545
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,695
carry Euler's identity.

546
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:56,570
All the rest follows.

547
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:03,910
All right.

548
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,638
So here is-- well,
actually, let me

549
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:16,930
make that point a little later.

550
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,010
These are easy.

551
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,830
e to the j0 is just--

552
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,440
this unit length vector
line along the real axis

553
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,330
is just the number 1.

554
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,480
e to the j pi, it's
the unit vector lying

555
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,740
along the negative real axis.

556
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,240
So that's the number
minus 1, right?

557
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,230
So here's how we use complex
exponentials to prove

558
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,510
the result that I claimed
earlier, namely that sinusoids

559
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,530
in gives you sinusoids out.

560
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,370
A sinusoid of a
given frequency in

561
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,440
gives you a sinusoid of
the same frequency out.

562
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,170
What we're going to
do is actually combine

563
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,630
sines and cosines
into one calculation.

564
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,630
This may look a little
funny, because now, we're

565
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:15,810
suddenly putting a complex
input into this LTI system.

566
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,088
But if you think about the
math that we did for LTI,

567
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:19,630
it didn't really
care whether we were

568
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,920
feeding in real numbers
or complex numbers.

569
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,040
So we could have
a signal that has

570
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,680
a real part and a complex
part at each time.

571
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,840
Convolution would work
exactly the same way.

572
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,320
We arrived at convolution
through linearity and time

573
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,680
invariance arguments, and all
those work for complex signals.

574
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,910
So we could actually be putting
in a signal of this type

575
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,470
and seeing what comes out.

576
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,980
Well, this is very close to
the calculation we did earlier

577
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,020
with a real exponential.

578
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,460
The only difference now is
it's a complex exponential.

579
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,750
But here's the computation.

580
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,630
We start, as always, with the
time domain representation.

581
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,250
That's convolution.

582
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,630
Substitute in for
x of n minus m.

583
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,260
x of n is this signal here.

584
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,060
I should have
labeled it as x of n.

585
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,092
So just stick x
of n minus m here.

586
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,550
And then, you
discover that there's

587
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,967
a part of this that doesn't
depend on the summation index.

588
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,540
So you pull that out.

589
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,170
So you're left with this
summation inside and this piece

590
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,389
out.

591
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,389
So look what's happened.

592
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,699
You've put in a
complex exponential.

593
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,920
And out comes the same
complex exponential

594
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,290
scaled by something.

595
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,699
What is this
complex exponential?

596
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:39,080
Well, its real part
is a cosine signal,

597
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,960
and the imaginary part is
a sine signal, all right?

598
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:50,110
So this object is something that
we'll encounter and use a lot.

599
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,639
It's referred to
as the frequency

600
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,650
response of the system.

601
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,350
You've heard the term used,
undoubtedly, in other settings.

602
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,900
But here's the definition.

603
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,540
It's a function
only of big omega.

604
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Because once you've
summed over m--

605
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,990
little m-- everything
else has gone away.

606
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,040
So only depends on big omega.

607
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,970
And here's what it is.

608
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:22,070
It's the summation over
all values of m, h of m,

609
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,490
e to the minus j omega m.

610
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:28,305
That's the frequency response.

611
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,730
So if you give me the unit
sample response of a system,

612
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,750
I can find for you what
the frequency response is.

613
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,440
So let's actually do an example.

614
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,940
Let's see.

615
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,412
Let's take one of your--

616
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,620
let's take an averaging
filter that you've looked at.

617
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,330
To make it easy on you, I'll
sketch it as a function of m.

618
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,440
It doesn't matter
what that's called.

619
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,880
So here's 1/3, 1/3 1/3.

620
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,330
We've come to recognize this as
B unit-sample response of a 3

621
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,030
point averaging filter.

622
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:39,120
It's a causal 3 point averaging.

623
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,780
So what's the frequency
response of this system?

624
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,070
Well, it's h of big omega.

625
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,770
And then I just follow
this prescription.

626
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,200
So the only values of h
that are non-0 are for m

627
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,180
equals 0, 1, and 2.

628
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:06,690
So it's going to be 1/3, 1
plus e to the minus j omega,

629
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,590
plus e to the minus j2 omega.

630
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,780
And I'm done, right?

631
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,500
Now, to actually get a feel
for this what you want to do

632
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,950
is write it in different forms.

633
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,940
For instance, a very
useful way to write this

634
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,130
is in terms of the
magnitude and the angle.

635
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,980
So here's a way to represent
any complex number.

636
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,010
This is a complex number, right?

637
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,560
I can write it as magnitude
times e to the j angle.

638
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,780
So that will actually turn out
to be a much more efficient way

639
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,500
to think about
frequency responses.

640
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:55,140
This is the magnitude of
the frequency response.

641
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,450
And this is the phase.

642
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,210
So how does that bring us
back to sines and cosines?

643
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,840
Let me actually go a little
bit out of order here,

644
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:33,071
and here's the basic statement.

645
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,970
From the result that
we have up there--

646
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,360
and I'll show you on the
next slide how to derive it--

647
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,090
what you can show is that if you
put a cosine into the system,

648
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,850
what comes out is the same
cosine, except its amplitude is

649
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,670
scaled by the magnitude
of the frequency response,

650
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,640
and the phase angle is increased
by the angle of the frequency

651
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,960
response.

652
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,020
So this is really--

653
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,603
if you know this as a
function of frequency--

654
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:03,020
if you know the magnitude and
phase angle of the frequency

655
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,910
response as a
function of frequency,

656
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:10,260
you can describe the response of
the system to any cosine input.

657
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,660
What if the cosine was a
little more complicated

658
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,100
than the one there?

659
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:29,180
Suppose I had-- suppose I
had cosine omega 0 n plus,

660
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,970
let's say, pi over 4 going in.

661
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,683
What comes out?

662
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:34,850
What do you think comes out?

663
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,350
Anyone?

664
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,150
I showed you a
particular case here.

665
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,120
How much new work would you
have to do if it was actually

666
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,410
a slightly shifted cosine?

667
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,280
Take a guess.

668
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Yeah?

669
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,680
AUDIENCE: Just replace n in the
output with n plus pi over 4.

670
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,370
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you just change this

671
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,260
by adding in an extra pi over 4.

672
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,243
So what comes out--

673
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:07,410
that's what you said, right?

674
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,357
Is that what you said?

675
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:09,640
OK.

676
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,490
Sometimes I'm guessing because
I don't hear that well.

677
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,710
So here's plus the
angle, and then

678
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,503
plus the additional pi over 4.

679
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:24,920
And this actually
will follow just

680
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,610
from time and variance
of the system.

681
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,717
So you can actually-- so this
is actually pretty general.

682
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:32,300
If you're going to remember one
thing about frequency response

683
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,420
in terms of what the
operational significance is,

684
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,848
for instance in a
laboratory experiment,

685
00:40:37,848 --> 00:40:39,140
this is the result to remember.

686
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,730
This is why frequency
response is important.

687
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,970
And the proof, very easy.

688
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,550
Once you have the basic result
with exponential inputs,

689
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,300
the proof is easy.

690
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,810
Because a cosine can be
written as the sum of these two

691
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,300
exponentials.

692
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,030
How do I get that?

693
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,920
Just from Euler's
identity, right?

694
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,390
Use Euler's identity for each
of these-- for e to the j, e

695
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:09,620
to the minus j, when
you add Euler's for this

696
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,000
and Euler's for this, the
sine terms cancel out.

697
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,260
So you get 2 cosine in the
numerator and you divide by 2.

698
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,960
So if you're stuck for a
derivation of a result like

699
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,670
this, go back to Euler's.

700
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,980
So cosine can be
written this way.

701
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,920
So when I feed a
cosine big omega

702
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,770
0n of the input, what
I'm actually feeding in

703
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,250
is a linear combination
of two exponentials.

704
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,820
But I know how to write the
response to an exponential.

705
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,390
If this exponential--
this sum of exponential

706
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,890
goes in, what comes out is the
corresponding sum of responses.

707
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,330
So it will be this exponential
times the 1/2 there,

708
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,700
scaled by the
frequency response.

709
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,690
That's what frequency response
does to an exponential.

710
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,050
And this exponential
comes out the same,

711
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,450
but scaled by the frequency
response-- evaluated

712
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,780
at the frequency of
that exponential.

713
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:09,780
So maybe you've-- you're having
trouble visualizing the result

714
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,740
that I'm invoking.

715
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,840
But it's the one
that we just proved.

716
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:21,135
If you have e to the ae
to the j omega n going in,

717
00:42:21,135 --> 00:42:23,010
let's say, at some
particular frequency omega

718
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:32,400
0 to a system with frequency
response h of omega, what

719
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,140
comes out is the same
exponential that went in,

720
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,270
scaled by the frequency response
evaluated at the frequency

721
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,740
that we're talking
about-- omega 0.

722
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,850
So when I label the system
with the frequency response,

723
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,070
this is a general omega.

724
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,520
But the value of it that I'm
interested in is the value of--

725
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,770
at the frequency of the inputs.

726
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,480
So if the input is e to the
j omega 0n, what comes out

727
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,490
is that same e to
the j omega 0n,

728
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,290
but scaled by the frequency
response at that frequency.

729
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,760
So that's what
I'm invoking here.

730
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Invoking it twice, well,
this is just the real part

731
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,460
of this quantity, because
it's a complex number

732
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,690
and its complex
conjugate, and so on.

733
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,830
So you put it all together,
and you actually very directly

734
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,190
have this result.

735
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,570
So we're using complex
inputs as just a trick

736
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,670
for getting the results
that we'd really

737
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,190
like to get for real inputs.

738
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,100
If you didn't want to do
that, you could actually just

739
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,890
put in the cosine omega 0n, and
crank it all the way through,

740
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,850
and you would get it.

741
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:46,790
So you could say yn equals
summation over all m, h of m.

742
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,160
Then we have x of n
minus m here, right?

743
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:57,120
So it's going to be cosine
omega 0, n minus m going in.

744
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,110
And now, use appropriate
algebraic identities and you'll

745
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,410
get the same result.

746
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,790
So we didn't have to use
complex exponential inputs

747
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,640
to get the result. It's just a
convenient way of getting it.

748
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,300
Again, if you're going to
carry one result in your head

749
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,850
in the complex case,
this is the one to carry.

750
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,660
It is very simple.

751
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,240
It says complex exponential in,
you get the same exponential

752
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,740
out.

753
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:28,640
So let's play a little more
with this particular filter

754
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,640
since we see that magnitude
and angle are so important.

755
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,750
We're talking-- we're back to
this 3 point averaging, right?

756
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,040
Here's the frequency response.

757
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,920
And I'd like to get
the magnitude out.

758
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,140
And you could certainly
use Euler's identity

759
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,600
on each of these pieces,
group all the real parts, all

760
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,520
the imaginary parts, and so on.

761
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,890
It ends up actually
being a bit of a mess

762
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,740
to try and write down cleanly.

763
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,330
So let me show you a trick that
works for this kind of thing.

764
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,500
And it'll give you some
practice in thinking

765
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,150
about these complex
exponentials.

766
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,560
Do you agree that I've just
rewritten the same thing

767
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,760
as I had above?

768
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,890
OK, does this simplify?

769
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,108
Can you write it
as something real?

770
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:45,650
We've got a complex quantity
and its complex conjugate there,

771
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,310
so we should be able to
collapse them into real, right?

772
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,220
The way you recognize a complex
conjugate is that the j has

773
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,630
gone to a minus j.

774
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,930
So what is this whole thing?

775
00:45:58,930 --> 00:45:59,872
Somebody?

776
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

777
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,650
PROFESSOR: Where
did that come from?

778
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,620
Can I have a hand, just--?

779
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,120
Oh, yeah.

780
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

781
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:15,220
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so let's say
1 plus 2 cosine omega, right?

782
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,910
So that's simplified nicely.

783
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:26,338
OK, so are we in a position to
say what the magnitude of h is?

784
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,560
I've got an h that
is represented

785
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,600
as the product of this.

786
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,950
Oh, by the way, sorry, I--

787
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,310
this should just be
a 3 here, not a 1/3.

788
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,350
Everyone shook their
head in agreement

789
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,610
when I wrote that down, but--

790
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,382
what's the magnitude of the
product of two complex numbers?

791
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,090
Is it the product of
the individual ones?

792
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,875
The magnitude of
h is going to be,

793
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:05,910
let's see 1/3 magnitude e
minus j omega times magnitude

794
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,420
1 plus 2 cosine omega, right?

795
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,140
The magnitude of a
product of complex numbers

796
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,420
is just the product of
the individual magnitudes.

797
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,090
What's the magnitude of this?

798
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,080
1.

799
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,140
So we're actually done.

800
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,080
We actually have a
very simple expression

801
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,030
for the magnitude of
the frequency response

802
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,310
of this moving average filter.

803
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,550
That's all it is.

804
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,190
Oh, sorry, I need
the absolute value.

805
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,650
So let's see, I
think I have that

806
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:40,880
sketched out in one of these.

807
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,060
I actually have three moving
average filters drawn out here.

808
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,910
The one that I've just
worked out is this case.

809
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,210
This is the 3 point
moving average filter--

810
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,970
a height of 1/3
for each of these

811
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,210
at 0, 1, and 2, and
everything else is 0.

812
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,848
Here is the frequency
response magnitude.

813
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,390
The notation that's used on the
figure is slightly different.

814
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:13,220
So some people, including me
in the next course I teach,

815
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,520
will write the
frequency response

816
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,380
as this instead of h of omega.

817
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,560
But that's really
unnecessarily fussy.

818
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,170
It's important when you're
talking about z transforms

819
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,670
at the same time
that you're talking

820
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,720
about Fourier transforms.

821
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,080
But for us, it's not important.

822
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,830
So you'll see slightly different
notation, probably in the notes

823
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,940
as well.

824
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,790
But just think of that
as just h of omega.

825
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,820
So here's the filter
we were talking about.

826
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,720
Here, supposedly, is the
frequency response magnitude.

827
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,280
What we should be seeing is
the magnitude of this quantity.

828
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,800
And let me see if
you believe it.

829
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,760
So what we have is--

830
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,580
so what I have is,
at omega equals 0,

831
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,080
I've got something
that starts at 1.

832
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:18,680
And then, when I get
out to minus pi over pi,

833
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,470
this has come down to
the value minus 1/3.

834
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,210
And so this is what I have for--

835
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,200
this is the quantity
within the absolute sine,

836
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,730
before I take an absolute value.

837
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,060
And when I take the absolute
value, this flips over.

838
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:41,920
And that's really what
you're looking at.

839
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,720
You're looking at frequency
response magnitude,

840
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,090
which is this.

841
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,200
And you've got to figure
out the phase accordingly.

842
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,050
And that I'll leave you
to do in recitation.

843
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,120
But I want to ask
you one last thing.

844
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,820
Why do I not bother
to plot the frequency

845
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,342
response beyond minus pi to pi?

846
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:08,090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

847
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:13,220
PROFESSOR: So the reason is that
the frequency response tells us

848
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,470
what the response is to
inputs of this type, right?

849
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,630
The frequency response
says if this goes in,

850
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,390
how much it gets scaled
by when it comes out.

851
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:30,360
Well, if I increase omega 0 by
an integer multiple of 2 pi,

852
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,200
I get the same
exponential back again.

853
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,160
So there's no new information
outside of minus pi to pi.

854
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,190
Another way to think
of it is we're really

855
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:47,710
talking about complex
numbers and their angles.

856
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,410
Once you've made a full
circle from minus pi to pi,

857
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,020
there's no new space to cover.

858
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,790
So you'll see frequency
response is only

859
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,890
plotted from minus pi to pi.

860
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,630
All the interesting
action is there.

861
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,255
All right, we'll
develop more intuition

862
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:04,290
for this in recitation and in
the next couple of lectures.
