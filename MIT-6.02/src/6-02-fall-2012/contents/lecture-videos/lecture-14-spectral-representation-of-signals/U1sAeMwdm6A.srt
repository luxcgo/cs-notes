00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,400
PROFESSOR 1: OK, let's
launch right into it.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,580
Jacob and Uri were inspired
by the echo channel

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,850
to try out a simulation of what
I'd put on the board last time

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,480
or on my slides.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,230
So what you're going to
hear is Jacob's message

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,550
going into the echo channel.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,790
Remember, that was something
with a unit sample response

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,480
of the type delta n plus.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,050
And actually, I
think in their case,

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:01,420
now it's 0.999 delta n minus 1,
so it is something like this.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,680
Sorry?

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,270
Oh, n minus 4,000, OK.

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,000
And so you'll hear the
original message, I think.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,330
You'll hear the message going
through the echo channel.

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,480
And then you'll hear
the message cleaned up

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,590
with the receiver filter.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,280
That's just the inverse filter.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,670
And then you'll hear what
noise does to it and two

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,310
flavors of noise, I think.

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,920
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,992
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

29
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:31,180
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,747
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

31
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,330
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,940
This is a test of the
602 deconvolution system.

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,100
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,590
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,887
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

36
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,470
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

[BELL DINGING]

38
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,580
PROFESSOR 2: I'm just going
to increase the delay,

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,122
so we can hear the
echo more clearly.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,010
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

41
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,840
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,400
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,500
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,427
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

45
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,510
PROFESSOR 2: So you can
all hear the echo in that.

46
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,030
And the next one will
be it cleaned up--

47
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,380
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,465
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

49
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,030
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

50
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,400
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,325
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

52
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,700
PROFESSOR 2: So
this was just one

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,327
in deconvolution, assuming
the channel had no noise.

54
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,160
The next one is what
happens if there's even

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,520
a small amount of
noise in the channel--

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,870
so little that you couldn't
hear it in the echoed signal.

57
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,340
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,450
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

59
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,960
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

60
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,330
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

61
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,913
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

62
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:22,330
PROFESSOR 2: So you can hear
the noise building up because

63
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,130
of the deconvolver.

64
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,338
If you actually had noise
at a particular frequency,

65
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,380
you end up with an even--

66
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,900
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

67
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,030
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,520
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,617
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

70
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,200
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

71
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,700
PROFESSOR 2: So one of the
difficulties with deconvolution

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,280
is it can be perfect
if you have no noise.

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,080
But even small amounts
of noise can really

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,460
mess up the deconvolution.

75
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,162
It magnifies the
small noise sources.

76
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,120
PROFESSOR 1: OK, great.

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,790
Thank you.

78
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,290
Thank you.

79
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,810
And that was a few
lines of MATLAB, right?

80
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,250
Same thing can be
done in Python.

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,625
All right, we continue.

82
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,149
So we're going to talk
today about spectral content

83
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,450
of signals after having spent
some time on the frequency

84
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,579
domain--

85
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,680
the frequency response
of LTI systems.

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
Let's get this up here.

87
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
So we've talked about
frequency response.

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,490
You've seen the definition.

89
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,212
If I give you the unit output
response of a system over here,

90
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:48,170
you know how to compute
the frequency response.

91
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,378
And then we went through
how you can go the other way

92
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:53,470
with the DTFT to
compute the frequency

93
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,520
response and the inverse DTFT to
compute the time domain signal

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,230
from the frequency response.

95
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,080
And what we said
last time was that

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,977
what you're doing with
a unit sample response,

97
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,560
you could actually
do with any signal.

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,610
So you can take
any signal x sub n,

99
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,430
compute from it the DTFT,
the Discrete Time Fourier

100
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,160
Transform, with
the same formula.

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,470
What you get is this object
that can be used then

102
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,570
to reconstruct the signal--

103
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,203
again, the same
formula, all right?

104
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:22,870
So there's just a
change of perspective.

105
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,320
There's nothing different here.

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
The key observation
now, though, is

107
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,620
that the formula on the
left, the inverse DTFT,

108
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,910
is actually allowing us to
represent x sub n, the time

109
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,840
domain signal, as a weighted
combination of exponentials

110
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,560
of this type.

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,157
And the reason
that's important is

112
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:47,240
that we know how to deal
with signals of that type

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,430
very easily.

114
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,670
We already know
that if you have e

115
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,090
to the j omega n going into
a system with frequency

116
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,410
response--

117
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,420
h omega, so an LTI system
with that frequency response.

118
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,390
Let me make this a
specific frequency omega 0.

119
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:14,230
What comes out is the frequency
response evaluated at omega 0,

120
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,440
multiplying what went in.

121
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,940
All right?

122
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,990
Nothing more
complicated than that.

123
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,370
So what now if
you had an x sub n

124
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,730
going in that was a weighted
combination of terms

125
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,695
of this type?

126
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,820
And I'm going to take a
weighted combination that's

127
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,780
actually a continuum.

128
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,820
It's not just a finite
number of terms.

129
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,610
I'm going to actually take
this particular weighted

130
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,330
combination.

131
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,600
So over some interval
of length 2 pi,

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,730
I take a weighted
combination like this.

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,410
So this is going over all
frequencies in our interval.

134
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,690
Let's take minus pi to pi.

135
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,480
I might as well write
in minus pi to pi--

136
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
keep it explicit.

137
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,020
You can think of this
as being approximated

138
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,040
by a sum in the usual fashion.

139
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,780
I'm not going to write this out.

140
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,180
But we know how to
approximate integrals by sums.

141
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,950
What the sum will
have is, for instance,

142
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,720
a typical term of the
type e to the j omega 0n.

143
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:23,490
And the weight that multiplies
it will be x omega 0 d omega,

144
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,510
right?

145
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,040
So we think of x omega
0 d omega as being

146
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,760
the amount of the exponential
at frequency omega 0

147
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,810
that's in x sub n.

148
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,400
So here is a representation
of how the signal is made up.

149
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
So then what would you say
is the output of the system?

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,930
If that's the input, and
this is an LTI system,

151
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,380
what's the output going to be?

152
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,020
Any ideas?

153
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,612
Somebody?

154
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:57,570
I thought I saw a hand.

155
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,280
No ideas?

156
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:15,210
What if instead of this, I had
a1 e to the j omega 1n plus a2

157
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,670
e to the j omega 2n going in?

158
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,538
Suppose that had gone in?

159
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:22,580
What would be coming out?

160
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,890
Folks, we're just two
weeks from a quiz, here.

161
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah?

162
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

163
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,630
PROFESSOR 1: So can
you tell me explicitly

164
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,679
what I would get in this case?

165
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:41,083
If this was x sub n,
then y of n would be?

166
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

167
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,010
PROFESSOR 1: a1h.

168
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,513
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

169
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:48,930
PROFESSOR 1: Is
it just omega, or?

170
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,680
STUDENT: It's omega 1.

171
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,847
PROFESSOR 1: Omega 1, right?

172
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:54,360
It's the frequency response
evaluated at the frequency

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,030
that you're interested
in, and then

174
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:03,360
e to the j omega 1n, and then
the response to the other term.

175
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,920
This is what
superposition is about.

176
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,540
So that wasn't so hard.

177
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,910
What if instead,
x sub n is given

178
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,140
by a continuum of
such exponentials?

179
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,900
Integrals are essentially
linear combinations,

180
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,210
but taken to the limit, where
it's not just a finite number.

181
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,770
So I'm not asking for
a proof of anything.

182
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,778
I'm asking for your conjecture
as to what the answer might be.

183
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,320
This is how math is
done, by the way.

184
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,010
You conjecture what the result
might be based on gut instinct,

185
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,970
based on well-educated
intuition.

186
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,720
And then you go back
and construct a proof

187
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,090
and hide all your tracks.

188
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,918
But engineers like to
work with intuition,

189
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,210
and often will stick with that.

190
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,710
Yeah?

191
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,801
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

192
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,990
PROFESSOR 1: OK, so what would--

193
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,130
can you give me the
explicit expression?

194
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,260
What's your guess?

195
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,150
This is going in.

196
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,600
It's a weighted combination of
exponentials with weights that

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,370
are given by x omega d omega.

198
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,404
So--

199
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:22,308
STUDENT: So you would get x
omega d omega [INAUDIBLE]..

200
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,010
PROFESSOR 1: Times what?

201
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,675
I didn't hear the last piece.

202
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,763
STUDENT: Times [INAUDIBLE].

203
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,430
PROFESSOR 1: Where's
the j omega coming?

204
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,995
What's the j?

205
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm missing-- oh,
e to the j omega?

206
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,400
All right.

207
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,663
So start again.

208
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:44,580
Oh, you don't want to?

209
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,230
STUDENT: No.

210
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,437
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

211
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,520
You're on the right track.

212
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,312
You got us started.

213
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,722
Anybody else?

214
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:52,430
I could show it to
you on the next slide,

215
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,430
but that will take all
the fun out of it, right?

216
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,708
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

217
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:04,280
PROFESSOR 1: OK, it's
probably that I didn't hear.

218
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,434
Can you tell it to me?

219
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:10,928
STUDENT: x omega [INAUDIBLE].

220
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:17,070
PROFESSOR 1: X omega times h
omega or e to the j omega n?

221
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,682
What did you say?

222
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:22,032
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

223
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,240
PROFESSOR 1: I'm willing to--

224
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:31,798
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
omega n times [INAUDIBLE]..

225
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,090
PROFESSOR 1: That's still
the part that went in, right?

226
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,513
Now it's got to get mapped
by a frequency response.

227
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,930
STUDENT: Yeah,
that's what I said.

228
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,760
PROFESSOR 1: OK, so
maybe you'd said that,

229
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,990
and I didn't hear it.

230
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,550
But now we've got
to assemble this

231
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,240
over all possible frequencies.

232
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,550
Well, we have the 1 over 2 pi.

233
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,180
Maybe this was said already,
and I just couldn't hear it.

234
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,910
All we're doing is
we're saying here's

235
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,250
a weighted combination
of exponentials going in.

236
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,890
The weights are given by
the x omegas or x omega d

237
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,850
omega, if you want to
think of it that way.

238
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,240
So what comes out
is the combination

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,590
of responses to each of those.

240
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,720
These are the things that go in.

241
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,510
For each frequency, you multiply
by the corresponding value

242
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,428
of the frequency response and
do that for all the frequencies

243
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:19,970
of the input.

244
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,513
So this is just applying
linearity and superposition.

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:49,850
So if I compare that with this
expression, which just tells me

246
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,580
how the time domain signal yn
relates to its DTFT, right?

247
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,980
This is just writing
the same thing for y

248
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,500
that I wrote for x over there.

249
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,270
If you compare the
two, what you discover

250
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,940
about the DTFT of the output?

251
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,750
Where's the weighted
combination?

252
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,390
It's whatever multiplies
e to the j omega

253
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,730
n in this expression, right?

254
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,180
So it's just going to
be h omega x omega.

255
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,770
So we've done a
complete analysis

256
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,620
of the input-output
response of the system

257
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,950
for essentially an
arbitrary input with just

258
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,470
a simple multiplication.

259
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,470
So look what we've done.

260
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,710
We've taken the input that
we were given, computed

261
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,220
the DTFT of it, which gives
us the spectral content,

262
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,130
and I'll spend some time
giving you intuition for that.

263
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,460
That's the spectral content
of the input signal.

264
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,160
What we've discovered is
that the spectral content

265
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,390
of the output is the spectral
content of the input scale

266
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,430
by the frequency response.

267
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,800
And once you have the spectral
content of the output,

268
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,472
you can reconstruct
the time domain signal.

269
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,680
So the big difference here
is there's no convolution.

270
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,720
You're just doing
a multiplication.

271
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:22,330
Instead of doing y of n
equals h convolved with xn,

272
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,840
we're just doing
a multiplication.

273
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,620
So once again, you see the
convolution of the time domain

274
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,470
maps to multiplication
in the frequency domain.

275
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,330
All right, so we'll build
up to the story again.

276
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,830
Let's get some intuition
for spectral content.

277
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,550
And let's take a
particular example.

278
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:55,440
So suppose I have an x of n
that's a one-sided exponential.

279
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,185
You've probably done things
like this in recitation already.

280
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,090
So this is a signal
that starts at time 0

281
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,160
and then starts at the value
1 and halves it each time.

282
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,650
So it's a discrete
time exponential.

283
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:18,410
And so what's the DTFT?

284
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,240
Well, you're going
to some from m equals

285
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,990
minus infinity to infinity.

286
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,630
But actually, this only
exists for positive--

287
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,730
for non-negative time.

288
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,220
So you're going to
get 0.5 to the n.

289
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,217
Or let's keep it at m.

290
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,296
That's just the definition.

291
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,990
Isn't it the definition?

292
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,726
I'll just use the definition.

293
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,337
So you can now sum an
infinite series here.

294
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,170
And what do you get?

295
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:08,530
You get 1 over 1 minus
0.5e to the minus j omega.

296
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:14,080
This is just summing a geometric
series because each term here

297
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,730
follows from the previous one by
multiplying by the factor 0.5e

298
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,270
to the minus j omega.

299
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,240
So it's a geometric
series with that ratio.

300
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,360
And so this is what the
sum works out to be.

301
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,930
So if you wanted to figure
out the spectral content,

302
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,090
you first compute the DTFT.

303
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:41,610
And then the most helpful way
to get a feel for the signal

304
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,890
is to look at the
magnitude of the DTFT.

305
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,745
And that's what's actually
plotted in this case.

306
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,120
This is taken from
somewhere that

307
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,530
used slightly
different notation,

308
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,900
but we'll talk through it.

309
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,650
What happened to the
top of my slide, here?

310
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,400
OK, it doesn't matter.

311
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,300
What I've plotted here
is the magnitude of x

312
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,790
and the phase of x.

313
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,060
To get that, you'll actually
have to convert this

314
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,589
to magnitude in angle form.

315
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,859
I'm not doing that for you.

316
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm assuming you've had
practice or will get practice

317
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,839
in recitation.

318
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,450
But the result of
that is a magnitude

319
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,300
that looks like this and a
phase that looks like this.

320
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,869
The horizontal scale, just
to make the point that this

321
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:24,480
is a periodic object, just
like frequency response,

322
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,980
it actually goes from
minus 4 pi to plus 4 pi.

323
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,270
But the interval of interest
is really just minus pi

324
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,450
to plus pi.

325
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:34,950
All right?

326
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,325
So it's just that
central portion

327
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:40,410
that's of interest-- similarly
here, minus pi to plus pi.

328
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,632
And then it replicates
periodically outside of that.

329
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:45,090
So we didn't really need to
show it to you outside of that.

330
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,382
This is just to make the point.

331
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,175
Another thing to observe
is that the magnitude

332
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:54,610
is an even function
of frequency,

333
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,170
and the phase is an odd
function of frequency.

334
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,440
So these are elementary
checks that you should make.

335
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
If you get an
answer that doesn't

336
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,387
satisfy those properties,
you've gone wrong somewhere

337
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:04,970
along the way.

338
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,230
If you look at the
top plot in this set,

339
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,510
the top plot is exactly
a signal of that type,

340
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,490
except I've chosen
a different number.

341
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,640
Instead of 0.5 to the n times
u of n, it's something else.

342
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,220
But here's a geometric--

343
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,260
sorry, a discrete time
exponential or geometric

344
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,590
series.

345
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,210
Now I've just plotted the
DTFT from minus pi to pi

346
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,900
to show you what the spectral
content of the signal is.

347
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,820
And I'm just plotting
the magnitude.

348
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,020
Ignore these labels.

349
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,820
These are the same
figures you saw earlier

350
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,660
for little h and big H.
I'm using them again,

351
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,950
except now I'm thinking
of this as a signal,

352
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,600
and this is its DTFT.

353
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,700
This is a signal, x sub n, and
this is its spectral content.

354
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,720
The relationship is exactly what
we had with frequency response.

355
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
So where is the spectral
content concentrated?

356
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,180
Is it at low frequencies
or high frequencies

357
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,840
or intermediate frequencies
for this first example?

358
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,550
Concentrated around
0, so you'd say

359
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,860
it's concentrated
at low frequencies.

360
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,870
There is content
on all frequencies,

361
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,480
though, so this doesn't dip
down to 0 anywhere else.

362
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,720
You have to assemble a
combination of sinusoids

363
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,260
at all frequencies to
construct this signal here.

364
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,640
Here is a signal.

365
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,470
I've had to change
the horizontal scale

366
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,170
because this is a signal that
evolves much more slowly.

367
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,590
Again, I can ask what's
the spectral content of it?

368
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,150
I get something which has
a peak near 0 frequency.

369
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,100
So it's only got low
frequencies in it

370
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,530
and has very little
high frequency content.

371
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,090
You can also start to
develop ideas for how fast--

372
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,560
how high a frequency you
ought to expect to see here.

373
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,980
So for instance, what's
the fastest wiggle

374
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,190
that you see in this signal?

375
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,440
About how long does it take to--

376
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,840
if you were thinking of
underlying sinusoids,

377
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,600
what's the fastest wiggling
you're seeing over here?

378
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,180
Well, to my eye, this kind of
rises and curves within about

379
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,310
18 or 20 samples, right?

380
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,850
So this might be a half period
of an underlying sinusoid.

381
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,983
So if I thought of
the period as being--

382
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,400
these are just
rough calculations.

383
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,040
But it helps you understand
what we mean by spectral content

384
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,820
and helps you as a way
of checking answers.

385
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,450
But let's see.

386
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:44,490
If I said 18 was approximately
a half period of an underlying

387
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,480
sinusoid, and I don't see
anything faster than that,

388
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,690
period is 2pi over omega 0.

389
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,800
So I'm saying that's
approximately 18.

390
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,110
So the frequency
that I expect to see,

391
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,190
the fastest frequency there,
is 2pi over 18 or pi over 9.

392
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,370
Is that roughly consistent
with what we're seeing there?

393
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,370
Does the spectral
content drop off?

394
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,420
Well, here is pi over 4.

395
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,630
Here's pi over 8.

396
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,760
Somewhere on pi over
9, we've run out

397
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,850
of underlying components.

398
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,920
It's because the
frequency content

399
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,820
is limited to that range that
the associated signal doesn't

400
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,200
wiggle any faster than this.

401
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,450
Here's another
example-- a signal

402
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,990
that actually--
well, in this case,

403
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,880
it seems to have some fairly
regular periodicity to it,

404
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,710
and then it damps out.

405
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,935
By the way, in all these
cases, I'm assuming--

406
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:46,310
actually, in all
these cases, I'm

407
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,800
assuming the signal's
identically 0 outside--

408
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,250
outside of what
I've shown you here.

409
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,250
If you take the
DTFT of this, you

410
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,550
find that the spectral content
is what-- low frequency,

411
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,978
mid frequency, high frequency?

412
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:02,882
STUDENT: Mid?

413
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:04,630
PROFESSOR 1: Mid
frequency right?

414
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,730
Because this is low frequency.

415
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,780
Here is 0.

416
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,340
This is high frequency.

417
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,440
This is just a reflection
on the left side.

418
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,390
So at some
intermediate frequency,

419
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,630
there's a peak in
the spectral content.

420
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,090
And again, you can go
through the rough calculation

421
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,150
I just made.

422
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,730
So we see some oscillation here.

423
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,230
Let's see.

424
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,313
Let's estimate the period.

425
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:27,070
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

426
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,110
Let's say it's about a period
of 5 for those oscillations.

427
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,800
So 2 pi over omega 0
is approximately 5.

428
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,370
So omega 0 is
approximately 2 over 5 pi.

429
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,660
So we expect to see a spectral
peak somewhere around 0.4 pi.

430
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,100
Here's 0.25 pi.

431
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,960
Here's 0.5 pi.

432
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,910
We're about right.

433
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,240
So make these sorts of checks.

434
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,291
Yeah, question?

435
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,874
STUDENT: So for that
first calculation

436
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:03,362
with the [INAUDIBLE].

437
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:09,060
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, sorry.

438
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,630
Yeah, I should have
done twice this, right?

439
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,790
What I did was estimate--
thanks for catching that.

440
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,920
I estimated at about
18 is the half period.

441
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
And so the period
I should have had--

442
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,830
36 here.

443
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,170
Good.

444
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,040
This is all ballpark,
of course, but no reason

445
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,740
to make it worse
than it has to be.

446
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,130
Vibrating, right?

447
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,340
And that's not exactly
where it sits down there,

448
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,650
but it's in the right region.

449
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,200
Now here's the part that we've
already seen on the board.

450
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,750
Once you know the spectral
content of the input,

451
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,300
you can assemble-- or you can
think of the time domain signal

452
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,880
as being made up of
those components.

453
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,980
Correspondingly, that's
what the output is.

454
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,750
And all we're doing
is invoking the fact

455
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,480
that this is an LTI
system for which we

456
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,370
know the frequency
response gives us

457
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,460
the output for
exponential inputs.

458
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,710
And then we compare
that with what

459
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,100
we expect to be seeing
for the DTFT of y,

460
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,760
and we make this conclusion.

461
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,330
So this is exactly
what we had earlier.

462
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,505
One thing to keep in mind, the
DTFT, the frequency response,

463
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,420
the DTFT--

464
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,150
these are all complex
functions of omega in general.

465
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,960
Each of them will have a
magnitude and an angle.

466
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,620
So make sure you understand
why the magnitude of y

467
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,920
is the product of the
magnitudes of h and x

468
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,740
and why the angle of y is the
sum of the individual angles,

469
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,240
all right?

470
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:04,940
It's basically the fact
that for a complex number c,

471
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,950
you can write it as
the magnitude times e

472
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,610
to the j angle.

473
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,560
So that's really what's
being invoked there.

474
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,000
So really, what the story
is about-- we've done

475
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,320
a lot of math along the way.

476
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,690
But this is really the story.

477
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,540
And I've only exposed
a little part of it

478
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,820
for you because I've only
dealt with DT signals.

479
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,490
But the same thing holds
for continuous time signals.

480
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,560
A huge class of
such signals can be

481
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,920
written as linear
combinations of sinusoids.

482
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,540
And when I say
"linear combination,"

483
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,890
it could be a combination
of a discrete set, finite

484
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,790
or infinite.

485
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,520
Or it could be a continuous
combination of exponentials

486
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,730
or sinusoids under an integral
sign, but the idea is the same.

487
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,560
If you've done 1803, you've seen
this kind of thing happening,

488
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,500
at least for periodic signals.

489
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,480
And then the other
piece of what we rely on

490
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,010
is that LTI systems are very
easy to understand in terms

491
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,660
of their action on sinusoids.

492
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,000
So once you put these
two pieces together,

493
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
you've got a very powerful
way to analyze LTI systems.

494
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,510
So just to go back to
the kind of example

495
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,280
I had last time, in,
which you'll be--

496
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,640
or you're already
dealing with in the lab--

497
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,920
we're talking about an
audio channel, for instance.

498
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,030
The frequency response, in
this case, is the magnitude.

499
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,650
Some characteristic here--
this is a bit of a cartoon.

500
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,650
But let me show you more
typical experimental plots

501
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,640
of frequency response.

502
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,040
This is frequency
response magnitude.

503
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,250
In most of these plots, people
don't show you the phase.

504
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,500
Part of the reason is,
or maybe the major reason

505
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,870
is, that for audio,
the ear is not

506
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,632
all that sensitive to phase.

507
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:56,590
If we were doing the
analogous thing for video,

508
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,660
then you'd be very
concerned about phase.

509
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,220
But in audio
characteristics, people

510
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,530
will typically only
show you the magnitude

511
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,180
because the phase
distortions aren't

512
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,600
picked up quite that readily.

513
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,160
So here is three speakers.

514
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,450
If you look on the site there,
you'll see many more tested.

515
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,510
This is the frequency range.

516
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,570
Now, I should make some
comments about that.

517
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:24,040
We're talking about
doing minus pi to pi.

518
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,710
We've been talking about
filters with frequency responses

519
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,490
that we show from
minus pi to pi.

520
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,020
So for instance, if I
had a band pass filter,

521
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,350
it would be something with--

522
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,830
in the ideal case,
something like this, right?

523
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,450
This is because
we're writing things

524
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,590
in terms of big omega for
a discrete time filter.

525
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,350
These are actually written--

526
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,910
the scale here is hertz.

527
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,410
And they're talking
about the action

528
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,610
on an underlying
continuous time signal.

529
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,140
So you actually need a way to
go from an underlying continuous

530
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,360
time signal that sampled at
a particular sampling rate--

531
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,075
let's say f of s
samples per second--

532
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,910
to a corresponding omega for
the underlying discrete time

533
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,530
sequence.

534
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,170
So the question is, how
does fs map to omega?

535
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,910
And I had a slide last time.

536
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,030
I haven't gone
through it in detail.

537
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,530
Maybe we'll have
you work through it

538
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,250
on a homework problem.

539
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,020
But this is actually
the mapping.

540
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,880
If you have a
sequence that comes

541
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,450
from an underlying
continuous time sinusoid

542
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,420
by sampling at fs
samples per second,

543
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,520
and you're doing all
your calculations

544
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,470
in the discrete
time domain, if you

545
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,720
want to think about what
that means for the underlying

546
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,910
continuous time domain, you
want to map pi to fs over 2.

547
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,560
It's not the omega
that maps to that.

548
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,160
It's the pi.

549
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,020
So for instance,
in the lab, I think

550
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,350
you're using 48
kilohertz, for instance,

551
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,860
at least for some part of
it, as a sampling rate.

552
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,880
You get a discrete time
sequence out of that.

553
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,830
You do various
DTFT-type computations--

554
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,560
spectral content or
frequency response.

555
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,930
Then you plot them on
this kind of a scale.

556
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,090
If you want to think about what
the underlying continuous line

557
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:41,290
frequency is, well, that's
24 kilohertz in this case,

558
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,980
and minus 24 kilohertz,
it's at this end.

559
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,520
So when you're
trying to visualize

560
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,910
what this characteristic is
telling you about what you're

561
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,470
seeing with a discrete
time sequence,

562
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,738
that's really the mapping.

563
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,530
The other thing about
these characteristics

564
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,650
is that people only plot
the positive frequency part.

565
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,000
So they ignore the
negative frequency because

566
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,025
of the symmetries there.

567
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,400
In applications, when they
give you a frequency response,

568
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,800
they will typically just give
you the positive frequency

569
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,890
part of that.

570
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,340
All right, so this is
what we're seeing here.

571
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,070
This is the characteristic
of the LTI system

572
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,190
that you're going to be
sending signals into.

573
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,357
And then you've got to
characterize the signals

574
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:30,940
that you're going
to send through it--

575
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,190
voice or music or whatever.

576
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,840
And this is a figure I
showed you last time.

577
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,350
But basically, you're looking
at the spectral content

578
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,170
of the signal of interest
and seeing how it matches up

579
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,030
with the channel that you have.

580
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,970
And if you compare with--

581
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,670
well, let's actually
look at the previous case

582
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,280
and get a few landmarks, here.

583
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,770
So let's take the Sony speaker,
for instance, down here.

584
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,470
OK, so it's got a fairly
flat frequency response

585
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,730
for a range of frequencies.

586
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,570
But you've got to get fairly
high up before you get there.

587
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:11,390
For frequencies lower
than about 100 hertz,

588
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,290
this is not doing a very good
job of propagating the sound.

589
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,790
The frequency
response is measured

590
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,350
by having a microphone at a
fixed distance from the speaker

591
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,922
in an anechoic chamber.

592
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,630
And you can see that
this one is actually

593
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,047
perhaps the poorest
of the-- it is

594
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:28,010
the poorest of the speakers
in that it does it very poorly

595
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,580
with the low-frequency sound.

596
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,260
So for this particular
one, you would

597
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,210
hope that the spectral
content of what you're

598
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,010
trying to send
through the channel

599
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,970
lives somewhere
in maybe 300 to--

600
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,030
300 hertz to 10 kilohertz--
if you want to get it across

601
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,710
the channel--

602
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,840
from the speaker
with high fidelity.

603
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,413
But if you've got
low-frequency signal

604
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:52,580
that you're trying to send,
and you use the speaker,

605
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,122
well, you're going
to be out of luck.

606
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,830
It's not going to
propagate it very well.

607
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,960
So thinking in terms
of frequency response

608
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,960
and spectral content
is really key to making

609
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,310
sense of a lot of this.

610
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,750
All right, let's get a little
more practice with this.

611
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,190
And I just want to show
you that once you've

612
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,050
learned how to deal
with frequency response,

613
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,570
there's not new stuff
that you're going to do

614
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,040
to deal with spectral content.

615
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,470
It's just a change
of perspective.

616
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,130
So let's see.

617
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,370
If I asked you for a signal
that had its frequency

618
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,122
content uniformly distributed
in some finite range,

619
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:31,580
can someone tell me what that
signal is going to look like?

620
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,460
I'm asking you for a
signal whose spectral

621
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:48,460
content is uniformly in
some range minus omega

622
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,435
c to plus omega c.

623
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,430
Have you met such
a signal before?

624
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,975
Anyone?

625
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:11,370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

626
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,171
PROFESSOR 1: Sorry?

627
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:14,280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

628
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,540
PROFESSOR 1: It was the unit--

629
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,790
we've seen the same kind of
thing with the unit sample

630
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,910
response to the low
pass filter, right?

631
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,590
So if this was a
frequency response,

632
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,540
then the associated
unit sample response

633
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,350
would be the signal
we're talking about.

634
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,880
So remember what
that was called?

635
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,480
We called it a sinc function--

636
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,130
sinc function in time.

637
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,160
So if the spectral content
is this in frequency,

638
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,338
then the signal that
you're talking about

639
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,630
is going to be a sinc function.

640
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,090
Now you can actually
work that out.

641
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,170
You don't have to
take my word for it.

642
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,020
You want flat spectral content
in the range minus omega

643
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,910
c to plus omega c.

644
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,330
So the signal that you're
going to get as a result

645
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,610
you can extract from
this computation.

646
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,900
And this is exactly the same
function that we saw last time.

647
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,090
So the DTFT does what your
eye may not do very well.

648
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,370
If I had just given
you the signal

649
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,230
and asked you to take
a guess as to what

650
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,980
the spectral content
of that is, you're

651
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,960
not very likely to
have ended up deducing

652
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,100
that the spectral content
is flat in some range and 0

653
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,340
outside of that.

654
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,739
So the DTFT is
valuable in actually

655
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,179
doing this analysis for you.

656
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,659
So there is a signal that
has flat spectral content.

657
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,389
More examples of
a similar type--

658
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,370
and again, we first
encountered these

659
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,949
in the context of unit sample
responses and frequency

660
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,580
responses.

661
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,747
But now, I just want to
change perspective and think

662
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:59,215
in terms of time domain signals
and their associated DTFTs.

663
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,490
So if we look at
the top one there,

664
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,920
this is the case we
just saw, except I've

665
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,900
truncated the sinc function.

666
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,657
And so what I get is not the
perfectly uniform distribution

667
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:13,990
of frequencies in some interval.

668
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,950
There's a little bit
of a wiggle to it.

669
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,160
But this is essentially
the sinc function

670
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,570
and its spectral content.

671
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,610
Here's another signal
whose spectral content

672
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,010
is at high frequencies
and essentially

673
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,710
0 in the low-frequency range.

674
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,460
What does it look like
in the time domain?

675
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,220
Well, you can
actually work it out.

676
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,330
And here's what you see-- that
this has actually more wiggle

677
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,150
to it than the sinc does.

678
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,270
Alternate samples seem to
take opposite signs, at least

679
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,420
of the dominant ones
over here, reflecting

680
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,600
the high-frequency
content of that signal.

681
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,660
Here's something
that's intermediate.

682
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,700
This also has the
oscillation in sign,

683
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,220
but it's not necessarily
in alternate samples.

684
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,390
It's a little bit
more leisurely.

685
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,490
Here's something that has low
frequency and high frequency,

686
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,960
but not intermediate frequency.

687
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,470
So you see a component
that's rapid wiggling,

688
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,030
but you also see this
lower-frequency content

689
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,530
in there.

690
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,150
So this is what the
DTFT does for us.

691
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,280
Now there's an issue of
how you compute these,

692
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:56,240
because if you look at
the formula for the DTFT,

693
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,590
you could certainly
do analytical things

694
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,120
with that expression.

695
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,430
And that's the case that--

696
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,070
we've treated cases of that
type, where you write down

697
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,160
an analytical
formula for the DTFT.

698
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,730
And then you do things
with that, like plotting.

699
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:18,170
But if I gave you some
numerical sequence here,

700
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,510
there's certain simplifications.

701
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,200
For one thing, you
really aren't going

702
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,705
to expect to compute this at a
continuum of values of omega.

703
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,080
You're not really
going to expect

704
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:35,440
to construct the values
from minus pi to pi

705
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,840
at every real number omega
in that interval, right?

706
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,310
That would take you a long time.

707
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,740
So what you're
likely to be doing

708
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,520
is asking for what the DTFT
is at some grid of points.

709
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,650
So you'll form a little grid.

710
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,198
And it's on that grid of
points that you want the DTFT.

711
00:37:58,198 --> 00:37:59,990
That's the only practical
thing you can do.

712
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,110
You're not going to compute
it at all omega outside

713
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,400
of toy examples like that.

714
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,150
So if you had a numerical
sequence collected in the lab,

715
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,170
for instance, this is what
you'd be aiming to do.

716
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,990
What's the other thing that's
likely to be the case if you've

717
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,180
got a numerical sequence
collected in the lab?

718
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,310
Any thoughts here?

719
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,610
It's unlikely that
my summation is

720
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,470
going to go from minus
infinity to infinity

721
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,345
because I'd be waiting
a long time to collect

722
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:32,470
that signal, right?

723
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,350
So in practice, what
we're dealing with

724
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,560
are signals of finite
duration, typically assumed

725
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,120
to be 0 outside
of that interval,

726
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,660
though you might have reasons
in some context for assuming

727
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,888
otherwise.

728
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:46,930
We're always going to take
finite length signals.

729
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,870
So the summation will be
over a finite interval.

730
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,050
And we're going to want
to compute the DTFT

731
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,090
on a finite group of points.

732
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,840
And that makes for
some simplifications.

733
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,630
So let's see here.

734
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,950
You've probably heard
people talk of FFT,

735
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,690
or the fast Fourier transform.

736
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,540
The fast Fourier transform is
not a new kind of transform,

737
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,530
so the name is a
little bit misleading.

738
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,570
It's a good way of
computing samples of a DTFT.

739
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,970
So you don't have to
learn a new transform.

740
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,270
We're still talking about
this object, the DTFT.

741
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,810
The FFT is an efficient
way of computing

742
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,170
the DTFT on a grid
of points, given

743
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,838
a signal of finite duration.

744
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,130
Now, I've got a lot on this
slide, and I hope all of it

745
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:33,630
is right.

746
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,450
But let me talk you through
the basic idea, here.

747
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:44,600
So we're going to
compute the DTFT

748
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,810
on a finite grid of points.

749
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,840
So that's the omega k's that
I've shown you over there.

750
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,820
We've only got a
finite duration signal.

751
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,320
Let me say that it exists
only from 0 to p minus 1.

752
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,000
So the signal is 0
outside of that interval.

753
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,350
And therefore, all the other
terms drop out of this.

754
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,660
So there's nothing
new in this formula.

755
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,550
This is just
acknowledging that I only

756
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,250
want to compute the
DTFT at a grid point,

757
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,350
and I only have a
finite duration signal.

758
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,480
Now the interesting thing
is that if your signal is

759
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,540
0 outside of this
interval, well,

760
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,220
that means your
signal is completely

761
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:35,660
specified if xn is known to be
non-zero only on the interval,

762
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,370
let's say, 0 to p minus 1.

763
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,470
So that's p values.

764
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,210
Then you would hope that just
having p samples of the DTFT

765
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,820
will allow you to
go the other way.

766
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,800
We know for sure
that if I gave you

767
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,800
the entire DTFT, if I
gave you the entire DTFT,

768
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:07,130
that you could go the
other way, because we

769
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,560
have this expression.

770
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,010
If I gave you the
entire DTFT, you

771
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,360
would just plug it into here.

772
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,990
And you'd get the
time domain signal.

773
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,450
What's interesting,
though, as it turns out--

774
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,040
and you might expect this.

775
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,620
Since your signal takes non-zero
values only at p points,

776
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,760
you only need p
samples of the DTFT

777
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,680
to get an exact reconstruction.

778
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,980
And here is the formula.

779
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,550
And the derivation is not hard.

780
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,540
I've omitted it here.

781
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,280
It's the same kind of idea
that we used in the full case.

782
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,930
But you can actually--

783
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:52,250
using the values of the
DTFT at these grid points,

784
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,200
you can reconstruct
the signal x sub n.

785
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,900
So with these
simplifications, you actually

786
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,950
have a simple pair that gets
you through the numerics.

787
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,430
If you followed these formulas
exactly as they're written,

788
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,310
you'd end up doing work
on the order of p squared,

789
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,200
because you see each
of these summations

790
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,467
involves taking p products.

791
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:15,800
And then you've got to sum them.

792
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,537
But you've got to do it at
p different frequencies.

793
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,120
And the same thing
on the other side--

794
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,290
you've got to do p products,
but you've got to do it p times.

795
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,820
So it's order p
squared computation.

796
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,910
The fast Fourier
transform is actually

797
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,060
a clever way of using
the symmetries associated

798
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,650
with these exponentials
to group the computations

799
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,650
and make it much faster.

800
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,310
And you can actually
reduce it to order p log p.

801
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,170
So it's a huge simplification.

802
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,960
I've got some illustrative
numbers down there.

803
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,750
So the FFT actually
is a major reason

804
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,150
for advances in
numerical computations,

805
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,103
including signal processing
of various kinds--

806
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:57,770
the fact that you can
get this reduction

807
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,708
from p squared to p log p.

808
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,500
All right, I don't
think I need to say much

809
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,550
about the grid of points.

810
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:10,880
But let's move on to thinking
about spectral content

811
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,602
of signals going
through channels.

812
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:14,810
All right, so we'll get
closer to signals of the type

813
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,268
that we're interested
in, which are

814
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:20,930
these signals in this
case for on-off keying

815
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,853
that are signaling 1's
and 0's and that we're

816
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,770
trying to get across a
channel-- for instance,

817
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,960
the audio channel.

818
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,590
So this might be a typical
finite length sequence.

819
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,410
This particular case, we had
chosen 7 samples per bit.

820
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,120
That's why the shortest
interval you see

821
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,240
has 7 non-zero bits, there.

822
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,020
Here's the spectral
content of the signal.

823
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,830
And actually, I've
taken this figure

824
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,080
from an earlier version
of the course, where

825
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,520
we talked about the discrete
time Fourier series,

826
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,710
not the discrete time
Fourier transform.

827
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,770
The discrete time
Fourier series turns out

828
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,090
to be something very
similar to the formulas

829
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,130
I showed you for the FFT.

830
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:06,380
So the discrete
time Fourier series,

831
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,780
apart from a scale factor,
is essentially a story

832
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,650
built around this relationship.

833
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,320
And that's developed in
some detail in Section 13.2,

834
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,330
but we're actually
bypassing about this term

835
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,870
to try and keep
the story simpler.

836
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,240
So when you see
these plots, you'll

837
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,600
see on a, at magnitude
a of k, that's

838
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,570
a symbol associated with the
discrete time Fourier series.

839
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,940
These are actually
Fourier coefficients

840
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,810
associated with the periodic
replication of this signal

841
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,702
outside.

842
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:41,910
So it's a discrete time
version of the Fourier series

843
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,910
you may have seen in 1803.

844
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,980
All you have to do when
you see a plot like this

845
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,600
is think of it as a scaled
version of the DTFT samples.

846
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,740
So we're just talking about
samples of the DTFT taken

847
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,120
at a grid of points.

848
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,030
The scale factor may be
off by a factor of p--

849
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,070
the length of the signal.

850
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,160
But the shape is entirely
told to you here.

851
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,220
So think of this as
samples of a DTFT.

852
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,800
We're going from
minus pi to plus pi.

853
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,210
What's down at
the bottom here is

854
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,990
imagining that you've sent
this signal over a channel that

855
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,110
could absorb the entire
spectral content of the signal.

856
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,556
So suppose you had a
channel whose bandwidth--

857
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:38,670
suppose I had a low pass
channel whose bandwidth

858
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,610
has got some cutoff.

859
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,540
This is low pass.

860
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,920
Suppose this
bandwidth could absorb

861
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,880
the entire spectral
content of the signal.

862
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,540
In other words, what I mean
is that all these DTFT numbers

863
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,550
that are significant
actually fit in under this.

864
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,930
So suppose your channel was
such that it didn't attenuate

865
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,520
the DTFT coefficients.

866
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,600
So the spectral content
is unmodified when

867
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,920
it gets through the channel.

868
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,370
And so if you resynthesize
the signal using this formula

869
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,660
at the receiving end, you'd
get back the same thing again,

870
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,525
because the channel's not
induced any distortion.

871
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,740
Let me go past this
and actually show you

872
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:35,160
what happens when you
start to distort the--

873
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,360
what goes across.

874
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,180
So here, what we're doing in
this succession of experiments

875
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,710
is sending that same
signal through a channel

876
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,040
with successively
smaller bandwidth.

877
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,800
So in the first case,
everything goes through.

878
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,970
There's no distortion.

879
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,040
You get the same
thing back again.

880
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,200
In this case, the
channel actually

881
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,510
has a cutoff that
ends up zeroing out

882
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,500
all spectral content outside
of some frequency range.

883
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,105
So it's a low pass
channel whose bandwidth

884
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:06,480
is not enough to take the
spectral content of what you're

885
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,110
feeding across.

886
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,420
So what do you expect to happen?

887
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,080
Well, the higher-frequency
components of the signal

888
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,160
have been zeroed out.

889
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,500
So what should happen?

890
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,410
You expect the signal to be
more rounded because it can't

891
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,520
make these sharp transitions.

892
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,070
It takes high-frequency content
to make sharp transitions.

893
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:31,043
So what happens is you trim the
spectral content by sending it

894
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:32,710
through a channel
that's not wide enough

895
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,500
to contain all of the
signal is that you

896
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,680
get a more rounded
signal at the other end.

897
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,180
So you sent this.

898
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,950
This is what you're receiving.

899
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,990
This is the distortion
that the channel

900
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,850
has imposed on your signal.

901
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,760
And you can imagine if you tried
to find a place to sample this,

902
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,650
you might run into some trouble.

903
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,570
If you go even
more extreme, here

904
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,360
is an even narrower channel.

905
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,060
What comes out is even more
rounded than what we had there

906
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,550
because you've taken away more
high-frequency components.

907
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,830
The signal just can't
wiggle that fast,

908
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:10,130
so it takes its leisurely time
going through its paces here.

909
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,190
And you can imagine that
you can be thrown off

910
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,770
when you try and take samples.

911
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,670
This is actually even more
evident on the eye diagram,

912
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,440
here.

913
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,030
So these are eye diagrams--
again, the same kind of thing.

914
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,190
As you successively
transmit fewer and fewer--

915
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,500
let's say less and less of
the high-frequency content

916
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,100
of the signal, what
gets picked up--

917
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,200
what gets received is
a more rounded version

918
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,610
of what was sent in.

919
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,230
And the corresponding
eye diagrams

920
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,330
that you construct--
well, at a certain point,

921
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,830
I guess somewhere
around here, you'd

922
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,710
be a little nervous about trying
to find a place to threshold

923
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,720
and decide on what
signal you have.

924
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,100
So this is not a noise issue.

925
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,630
This is a distortion issue.

926
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,300
It's distortion
induced by the channel.

927
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,100
And it can all be
understood in terms

928
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,040
of what the channel is doing
to the spectral content

929
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,420
of the input.

930
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,350
I think we'll continue next time
to get more insight into this

931
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,330
and start on the
topic of modulation.
