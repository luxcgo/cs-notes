8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,460
PROFESSOR: There's quite a
bit I want to go through here.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,650
so we're going to talk
today about modulation,

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,950
which you've already
gotten some notion of,

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,920
and that's basically the task
of matching a transmitted signal

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,810
to the physical medium.

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,710
And then we'll talk about
demodulation, as well.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,210
Whoops.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,210
So just to remind you of
how we got into this story,

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,650
we started off
talking about bits

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,315
that we had to get across
to a receiver from a source.

18
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,940
And we've been spending
quite some time

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,440
now focusing on this
piece of the system, which

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,020
is taking the bits,
converting them

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,570
to actual physical
samples of a voltage,

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,580
for instance, and then
trying to get them

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,700
over some physical medium.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,530
And then, at the other end,
converting back to bits,

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,030
all right?

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,955
So this is really a key
piece of the system.

27
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:27,830
If you can't get it over
the physical medium,

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,862
then you don't have anything.

29
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,820
So we've been spending
quite some time on that.

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,430
We've talked about models
for signals and models

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,490
for systems, LTI
models for systems,

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,760
all in the time domain.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,790
And then we came to the
frequency domain, which

34
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,980
we said will make
things a lot simpler,

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,730
and actually is the way that
people think about transmission

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,000
on physical media, typically.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,420
OK, so the actual math.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,540
Well, we've seen--
this is just review.

39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,180
We've seen that, most
recently, that you can actually

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,650
represent any signal as
a weighted combination

41
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,440
of exponentials, so this
was the transform domain

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,000
representation.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,380
And the weights here were given
by the discrete-time Fourier

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,010
transform.

45
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,620
So you give me a signal,
I can find for you

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,770
the discrete-time Fourier
transform, which then tells me

47
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,830
how to assemble complex
exponentials to get

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,660
the signal of
interest, all right?

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,110
And so this Fourier
representation of the signal

50
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,250
is really the frequency
domain thinking.

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,350
And then we saw how to apply
that actually to a system.

52
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,620
We have an LTI system,
therefore characterized

53
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,630
by a frequency response.

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,550
We first introduced
the frequency response

55
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,190
as a way of thinking about
what happens to cosines.

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,920
Put a cosine in,
and you get a cosine

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,110
out that's scaled by the
magnitude of the frequency

58
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,790
response and with
the phase shifted

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,340
by the angle of the
frequency response.

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,030
And then we went from
cosines, or in parallel we

61
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,780
talked about exponential
inputs, so inputs of this type.

62
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,120
And now we have more
generally a signal

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,000
that's represented as a weighted
combination of exponentials

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,350
of that type.

65
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,410
Out comes the same weighted
combination of exponentials,

66
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,750
except each one is
scaled by the frequency

67
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,940
response as appropriate.

68
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,440
And then comparing
that with what

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,000
we expect as a spectral
representation for the output.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,680
We get this key
relationship, which

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,550
is relating the input and
the output of a system,

72
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,340
an LTI system, that's governed
by a frequency response.

73
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,580
So now we're starting
to think in terms

74
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,520
of the spectral content of
the input, all right, which

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,770
is the frequency domain
description of the signal that

76
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,640
goes into the system.

77
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,400
Then the frequency
response of the system

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,150
shaping that spectral content
to give you the spectral content

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,470
of what comes out, all right?

80
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,150
So this is the language
and the picture

81
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,620
that we have, and it's all
as simple as multiplication

82
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,990
once you've figured out
what the spectral content is

83
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,240
of the signal of interest,
once you have the frequency

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,570
response of the system.

85
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,440
So we've got to know
how to do those pieces.

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,780
And then we talked
most specifically

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,590
about a physical medium
that's close to what you're

88
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,560
doing in the lab, which
is the medium of, well,

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,120
an acoustic channel
driven by a loudspeaker,

90
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,690
and at the other
end are a microphone

91
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,290
to pick up the signal.

92
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,740
And I showed you these
typical characteristics

93
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,370
of loud speakers, the kinds that
you'll find listed everywhere,

94
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,590
three different speakers.

95
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,090
I mentioned last
time that, when you

96
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,370
look at frequency
specs for speakers,

97
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,930
people will typically only show
you the magnitude specification

98
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,350
because, for audio applications,
the phase distortions are

99
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,370
a little less important.

100
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,280
They tend to not be
picked up by the ear.

101
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,820
All of these-- let's see
they have passbands from--

102
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,190
this pointer's a
little weak here, but--

103
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,460
passbands from around 100 Hertz
to, let's say, 10 kilohertz.

104
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,000
So in that region, they pass
signals more or less uniformly

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
in at least the magnitude
characteristic, and then

106
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,110
near the edges they taper off.

107
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,780
And some speakers will
have bigger passbands,

108
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,090
and will taper off closer to DC.

109
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,880
Other speakers actually
will not pass frequencies

110
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,453
till you get till about, oh,
what is that, 120 Hertz or so

111
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,870
on this characteristic,
but you've

112
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,500
got to get way up before you get
anything through that speaker.

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,990
But nominally, we can
think of speakers,

114
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,160
since they're aimed at
audio applications--

115
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,660
what?

116
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,560
The ear here is something on the
order of, let's say, 100 Hertz

117
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,930
to 10 kilohertz.

118
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,630
OK, but the phase characteristic
is important, too.

119
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,220
It's not important,
maybe, when you're

120
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,560
talking about sending
audio on a speaker,

121
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
but in Audiocom in the
lab, you're actually

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,540
sending pulses across it.

123
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,797
You're communicating
something other than audio.

124
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,630
You're actually trying
to get a signal whose

125
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,890
particular shape matters.

126
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,720
It's not how you hear
it, but what it looks

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,390
like before you sample it, OK?

128
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,210
So in settings like that,
the phase characteristic

129
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,610
is important, as well.

130
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,440
Now, you haven't
explicitly probed

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,320
the frequency characteristic
of the speaker you're using.

132
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,300
You could do that,
but instead you've

133
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,977
been looking at things like step
responses in the time domain

134
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:13,560
and constructing eye
diagrams, but you

135
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,360
could look in the
frequency domain

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,090
and characterize your particular
channel for your laptop sitting

137
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,590
in a particular place.

138
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,390
You could look to see what the
magnitude and phase are like.

139
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,320
OK, so I want to go through
this exercise of looking

140
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,850
at the spectral
content of a signal

141
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,130
you want to get across
this audio channel,

142
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,650
and then looking at how the
audio channel shapes it,

143
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,460
and then what you pick
up at the other end.

144
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,330
So just to give you a feel for
how one thinks through this.

145
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,100
So the input in the
typical application

146
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,310
you have for Audiocom you have--

147
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,010
let's see, if you wanted to
signal just a 1 and then all

148
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,780
0's.

149
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,850
You would have 256
samples at height 1,

150
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,430
and then everything
from then on 0, OK?

151
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,370
So what I'd like to do is think
through how this pulse gets

152
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,290
across the medium, but thinking
it through in the frequency

153
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,293
domain, all right?

154
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:12,960
So the first thing
we have to figure out

155
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,443
is, what's the spectral
content of this pulse?

156
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:18,360
By the way, if we
understand it for one pulse,

157
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,040
then we can understand
it-- then we know it

158
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,748
for a sequence of
pulses because if we're

159
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:24,620
modeling the system as
time-invariant, once we figure

160
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,370
out what one pulse
does, we can figure out

161
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,080
what a later pulse will do.

162
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,570
It's just the same response
delayed in time, OK?

163
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,100
So the key to it
is understanding

164
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,010
what happens with one pulse.

165
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,630
So the spectral
content of the signal

166
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,180
is what we're interested in.

167
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,030
And my question is, do
you have any guesses

168
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,480
as to what the spectral
content might be, just roughly,

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,040
qualitatively?

170
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,220
Where do you think the energy
of the signal is concentrated?

171
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,830
What frequency ranges?

172
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,400
Any thoughts?

173
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,060
I'll need a hand up and a
loud voice so I can figure out

174
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,560
what's--

175
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,636
at least one?

176
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:09,564
Yeah?

177
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:10,030
AUDIENCE: Low frequency.

178
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,655
PROFESSOR: Low
frequency is a good idea

179
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:14,660
because, for most
of this signal,

180
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
you've got essentially
nothing happening, right?

181
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,285
It's just flat.

182
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:21,790
So you expect high
spectral content at DC.

183
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,540
But there is this
sharp transition,

184
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,730
so you might expect high
frequencies associated

185
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,250
with that.

186
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,600
So do you think it might
be low frequencies and then

187
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,870
high frequencies, not much
in between, or any thoughts?

188
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,250
OK, well, let's look
at what it actually is.

189
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,140
Let's work it out.

190
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:54,530
So we're talking about a
signal that's at height 1.

191
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,030
For-- let's do the general case.

192
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,050
So let's say it's for
n samples, so from 0

193
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,430
to n minus 1 its height 1, and
then it's 0 outside of that,

194
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:04,930
OK?

195
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,570
So suppose this is x of n.

196
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,940
How do we determine
the spectral content?

197
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,470
Well, we've got to write the--

198
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,070
we've got to compute
the DTFT, right?

199
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,550
So what's the DTFT?

200
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:28,510
It's a summation x m e to the
minus j omega m over all m.

201
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,360
But in this case, it
simplifies, right?

202
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,000
Because there are only a few
non-zero values of the signal.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,770
So this is going to be--

204
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,270
let's see.

205
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,720
It's going to be x0 e to
the minus j omega 0 plus x1

206
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,170
e the minus j
omega 1, and so on.

207
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,260
That's going to be 1 plus
e to the minus j omega

208
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,610
plus e to the
minus j2 omega plus

209
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,708
e to the minus j
N minus 1 omega.

210
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,500
So that's the DTFT.

211
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,170
But till you work with
that and get it in a form

212
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,970
that you can make
sense of, you still

213
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,150
don't have a feel for where the
frequency content is, right?

214
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,400
You've got to--
the best way to get

215
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,910
at that is to think of what
the magnitude of this will be.

216
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,590
And even then, it's
not obvious how

217
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,230
to think about the magnitude
of a sum of complex numbers

218
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,580
like this, so you've got to
play with it a little more.

219
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,718
OK, well, this is a
geometric series, right?

220
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:26,510
Each term is obtained
from the previous one

221
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,990
by multiplying by to
the minus jam omega.

222
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,420
And so if you've got the
sum of a finite number

223
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,980
of geometric series of
this type, what do we have?

224
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:42,790
We have that as the sum, right?

225
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,990
You agree?

226
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,350
So this was the factor by
which we multiply each term.

227
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,850
Sorry.

228
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,100
And we've got N such
terms, so you're summing

229
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,560
N terms of a geometric series.

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,340
Well, we might be getting closer
here to extracting a magnitude,

231
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,850
but you really want to do a
little bit more massaging here.

232
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,540
Let's see.

233
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,900
If I make this e to
the j omega N over 2,

234
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:21,750
then here's e to the
j omega N over 2,

235
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,810
minus e to the minus
j omega N over 2.

236
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,642
And this is a trick we've done--

237
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:33,975
we've played a few times before.

238
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,600
Right?

239
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,290
I've just rearranged things.

240
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,790
Let's see.

241
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,320
How have I helped myself here?

242
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,550
Have I helped myself at all?

243
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:03,930
So what is-- what
does that simplify to?

244
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,090
Well, the factor in front I
can write as some phase term e

245
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:17,370
to the minus j omega
N minus 1 over 2.

246
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,370
And what's this?

247
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,943
Anybody?

248
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,260
Numerator?

249
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,010
Does the numerator
remind you of anything?

250
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,450
Sine?

251
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,810
Sine omega N over 2?

252
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:51,280
And the denominator,
sine omega over 2, right?

253
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,520
So now it starts to look a
little bit more manageable.

254
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,680
If I wanted to get
the magnitude of this,

255
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,420
well, the magnitude
of this is going

256
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:04,690
to be the magnitude of this
piece times the magnitude

257
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,750
of that piece.

258
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,110
What's the magnitude
of the first term here?

259
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,800
Just 1, right?

260
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,650
It's e to the j something,
so its magnitude is 1.

261
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,690
So here's the
magnitude of the DTFT,

262
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,160
so that's the spectral
characteristic,

263
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,406
and that's something
that we can plot.

264
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,380
AUDIENCE: Question.

265
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,140
PROFESSOR: OK.

266
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,850
Sorry.

267
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,686
Question, hi.

268
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:28,552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

269
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:29,260
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

270
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,890
Say that again?

271
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

272
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,680
PROFESSOR: Did I make a
mistake somewhere here, or?

273
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh, this thing?

274
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,910
This term here?

275
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,550
I was trying to combine
numerator and denominator here.

276
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,623
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

277
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:46,540
PROFESSOR: Which part?

278
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,200
Sorry.

279
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,700
I have to stand
where you are to see

280
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,648
if I made a mistake because
it's hard to see close up.

281
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:56,151
AUDIENCE: Over the-- like,
when we go from the 1 minus e

282
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:58,870
to the minus 2 again
to the other one,

283
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,870
why are we dividing by two?

284
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,410
PROFESSOR: Oh, what are we-- oh.

285
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,480
Why are we dividing by 2?

286
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,270
Because when you multiply it
out, that's what it takes.

287
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,980
I'm trying to group things to
get something interpretable.

288
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,260
I don't know what
this is, but I know

289
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,390
what the numerator
over sine looks

290
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,960
like, so I'm trying to
make this a little bit more

291
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,610
equally distributed, right?

292
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,920
So if I pull out that
factor, what's left?

293
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,180
Looks like part of a sine.

294
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,680
OK?

295
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,140
So I'm just-- so it's
this time this gives me

296
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,790
the numerator here.

297
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,710
And this times this gives
me the denominator here.

298
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,080
So it's just rearranging terms.

299
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,510
We've used this trick before.

300
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,427
Any trick that works
twice is a method, OK?

301
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,760
So we really have a method here.

302
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,660
It's not just a trick.

303
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,160
If it works three times, you
can make a religion of it.

304
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,920
OK, so that's the
derivation we have here.

305
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,720
What's the height of
this at the origin?

306
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,010
Let's just focus on that term.

307
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,800
OK, so this is the magnitude
we're talking about.

308
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,920
What's the height at the
origin, at omega equals 0?

309
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,870
Well, now you can use
L'Hopital's rule, right?

310
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,630
Because omega is something
that varies continuously.

311
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,520
So for small values of
the argument, you're

312
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,810
really looking at something
of height N. And then,

313
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,410
when is the first time
that this goes to 0?

314
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,330
Well, for small
values of frequency,

315
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,680
the numerator is
not changing sign,

316
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,740
and this first
goes to 0 when you

317
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,003
get to omega equals 2 pi
over N, to private capital N.

318
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:53,670
So actually, instead
of saying all that,

319
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,045
I should just draw
you a picture.

320
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,160
There's a picture of
one particular case.

321
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,055
So this is a case where,
actually, the pulse

322
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,190
didn't start at 0.

323
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,750
It was symmetrically
located around 0, OK?

324
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,550
It was a pulse of length 11
symmetrically located around 0.

325
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,460
And because it was
symmetrically located,

326
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,640
this phase factor went away,
and all you're left with

327
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,310
is the sine omega N over 2
divided by sine omega over 2.

328
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,770
So you're looking at the actual
DTFT of a pulse of that type,

329
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,270
OK?

330
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,960
So this started at minus
5 and went to plus 5,

331
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,600
and was 11 samples long and was
0 everywhere outside of that.

332
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,240
So that's what
this function looks

333
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,753
like, the sine omega N over 2
divided by sine omega over 2.

334
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:53,920
Does it remind you of a
function you've seen before?

335
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:58,065
Sinc?

336
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:59,910
A sinc function?

337
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,410
It's very close to a sinc.

338
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,859
The sinc, though, had just
frequency in the denominator.

339
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:07,020
It didn't have sine of
something in the denominator.

340
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,380
And the reason this
appears is, remember

341
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,910
that transforms and
frequency responses

342
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,710
have to be periodic
with period 2 pi.

343
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,829
So it certainly
wouldn't be possible

344
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,960
for the transform of
a signal to be a sinc

345
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,172
because there's no
periodicity in the sinc.

346
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:25,630
But when you work
it out carefully,

347
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,170
you find that it's
something close to a sinc,

348
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,330
but one that has exactly
the right periodicity,

349
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,030
so this thing will
repeat periodically

350
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,470
with period 2 pi, exactly
the way it's supposed to.

351
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,240
So it's sort of sinc-like.

352
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,460
For small values
of omega, the sine

353
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,590
is essentially
just omega over 2,

354
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,450
and it is essentially a sinc.

355
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,550
But when you get to
larger values of omega,

356
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,215
this thing starts
to play a role.

357
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

358
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,990
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

359
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,692
Sorry?

360
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:54,780
AUDIENCE: Does the
magnitude mean anything?

361
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,197
PROFESSOR: I haven't-- I'm not
plotting the magnitude now.

362
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,290
I was plotting the actual
DTFT for this case.

363
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,150
So in this symmetric
case, the actual DTFT

364
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:10,570
is the sine N omega over
2 over sine omega over 2.

365
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,050
So I was plotting
the actual DTFT.

366
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,930
And the magnitude of the
DTFT I get just by taking

367
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,173
absolute value, right?

368
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,213
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

369
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:26,630
PROFESSOR: Well, I did this
for a case of a pulse starting

370
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,850
at time 0, OK?

371
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,430
So this factor came
purely from where I

372
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,510
located this on the time axis.

373
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,960
So different positions of
this pulse on the time axis

374
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,590
will modify this factor but
won't touch this factor, OK?

375
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,690
Shifts in time correspond
to multiplication by e

376
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,360
to the minus j omega
something, right?

377
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,310
You've seen that in recitation.

378
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,680
So whenever you shift
the pulse in time,

379
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,010
what it does to the transform
is it leaves this part intact

380
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,450
and affects this
factor, but that

381
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,840
doesn't change the magnitude
of the transform, OK?

382
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,740
So in the case of a
symmetrical pulse,

383
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,950
symmetrical about
the origin, actually

384
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,950
that phase factor goes away,
and the actual transform

385
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,210
is just that piece without
the e to the anything.

386
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,710
Sorry.

387
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,000
I jumped over a few
steps in describing that.

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,140
Just to go back a second.

389
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,150
This is not a sinc
function, but it's actually

390
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,420
referred to as a periodic sinc.

391
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,800
It's got a fancier name, also.

392
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,160
It crops up all over the place.

393
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,240
Height N at the origin
and the first zero

394
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,610
crossing at 2 pi over cap N.
So as you make the pulse wider

395
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,480
in time, you make it
narrower in frequency, right?

396
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,610
As N becomes larger, you
make this wider in time.

397
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,970
The main lobe of this
frequency distribution

398
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,770
gets more concentrated,
and frequency gets

399
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,540
closer to being a DC signal.

400
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,350
Makes sense, right?

401
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,600
The longer that
this stays constant,

402
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,480
the more the signal looks
like just DC and the more

403
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,130
the frequency is
concentrated at the origin.

404
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,760
But what you can see
here is there's actually

405
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,100
a full spread of frequencies.

406
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,970
It's not that there's just low
frequency for the flat parts

407
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,710
and high frequency
for the vertical edge

408
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,668
and nothing in between.

409
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:16,840
There's actually a full
spread of frequency components

410
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,610
that it takes to
make up that step.

411
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,030
OK.

412
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,410
If you had a pulse
that wasn't centered--

413
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,420
this is just to show you.

414
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,470
Here is a pulse-- actually,
this is not centered.

415
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,260
It's only 10 long, but
the magnitude here you're

416
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,740
only seeing half the
frequency scale, so 0 to pi

417
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,630
essentially, except
this is in terms

418
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,830
of f, which is omega over 2 pi.

419
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,020
You get the same kind of
magnitude characteristic,

420
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,060
but now because you've
shifted it off-center,

421
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,700
you've got a linear-phase
characteristic,

422
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,880
and what you're seeing here is
a linear-phase characteristic,

423
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,970
except every time you
have a flip in sign,

424
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,220
you jump the phase by
180 degrees, right?

425
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,440
When you change the
sign of something

426
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,440
from a plus to a minus,
that's like adding 180 degrees

427
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,980
to the phase or subtracting
180 degrees to the phase.

428
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,120
So you can spend time on all
of this and make sense of it.

429
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,540
But the basic idea is that you
get the sinc-like distribution

430
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,520
and frequency.

431
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,010
OK, so let's get back to
the particular pulse that's

432
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,650
of interest to us,
which is that pulse.

433
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,230
So it's the same kind of
thing, except N is 256.

434
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,110
And what I've
plotted for you here

435
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,070
is the magnitude of the DTFT.

436
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,400
It has the sinc-like shape.

437
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,470
I haven't actually plotted it as
a continuous function of omega.

438
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,058
Instead, I've used the FFT.

439
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:42,600
You remember?

440
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,770
We talked about the
Fast Fourier Transform.

441
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,330
So what the fast Fourier
transform is going to do

442
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:57,120
is, if the actual magnitude
DTFT was some continuous thing

443
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,760
like this, the fast
Fourier transform

444
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,900
is going to give me samples
of it, as many as I want.

445
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
But the more samples
I ask for, the more

446
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,420
work I have to
do, of course, OK?

447
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,598
I asked for 48,000
samples of the DTFT

448
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:16,390
so that I could get a
nice big spread here.

449
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,690
If your samples came from
sampling at 48 kilohertz,

450
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:29,530
for instance, then
the rightmost end

451
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,250
that corresponds to pi in
terms of actual frequency

452
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,740
would correspond to the
sampling frequency divided by 2,

453
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,410
so that's 24 kilohertz
sitting there.

454
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,580
So I actually have 24,000
points for 24,000 Hertz,

455
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,640
so I've got one point
at every Hertz position,

456
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,232
but I could pick anything else.

457
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:49,690
The other thing I
wanted to mention

458
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,270
was that the reason
I could do this

459
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,430
is because I'm using the FFT.

460
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,790
Because I told you
if I just did sort

461
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,430
of simple-minded
implementation of the formula,

462
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,610
I would take order p
squared computations,

463
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,240
where p is the length of the
signal that I'm looking at.

464
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,375
If I use the FFT, I
go from p squared to--

465
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:19,270
I go down to p log to the
base 2 of p, all right?

466
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,080
Well, the number of points
I have here is 48,000,

467
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,530
so going from p to log 2 p is
going from 48,000 to 16, which

468
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,670
is a factor of 3,000.

469
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,670
So the difference is I'm
sitting at the terminal

470
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,540
and I hit the Return
key to get the FFT,

471
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,180
and maybe at 0.1
seconds later, I

472
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,700
get the answer,
versus if I didn't

473
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,395
use the FFT I'd
wait five minutes,

474
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,270
and then I wouldn't be
trying to put together

475
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,970
these figures for you.

476
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,860
OK, so the FFT really makes
a real practical difference,

477
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,690
and it really revolutionized
how numerical computations

478
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,830
were done.

479
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,735
OK, so here you now see the
full spectral distribution

480
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,110
if you're willing
to let your eye

481
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,135
interpolate between these
samples that I've got.

482
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:10,240
You see the full
spectral distribution

483
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,220
of that rectangular pulse, OK?

484
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,890
So a short pulse in time.

485
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,530
It's got certainly
high DC content,

486
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,040
but it's got tremendous
frequency distribution, all

487
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,420
the way out to high frequencies.

488
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,753
In fact, all the way to the end.

489
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,560
You're still seeing
frequency content.

490
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,070
It's visible to the eye.

491
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,040
So all the way out
to 24,000 Hertz,

492
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,010
and you could keep
going all right?

493
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,810
This is not a sinc.

494
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,600
It's a sinc-like function
because if you extended it,

495
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,190
it would go back up again.

496
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,520
It's got that period, 2
pi, exactly as it should.

497
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,260
But for all intents
and purposes,

498
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,450
for small values of frequency,
the sine omega over 2 here--

499
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,890
this is essentially
omega over 2,

500
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,665
and this is a
sinc-like function, OK?

501
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,665
Now, this is different
from what you saw before.

502
00:24:55,665 --> 00:25:02,000
Before you had a constant
segment and frequency.

503
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,750
At least, I think it's
different from what

504
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,125
you've seen before,
unless you've

505
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,360
done examples in recitation.

506
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,060
But before what we
had was, for instance,

507
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,720
trying to get a
frequency response that

508
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,430
was like this, right?

509
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,150
We ended up with a unit
sample response that

510
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,980
was a sinc function in time.

511
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:29,270
This is going the other way.

512
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,610
This is a rectangular
function in time,

513
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,270
giving rise to a sinc-like
distribution in frequency.

514
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:43,210
All right.

515
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,740
Let's zoom in a little bit
just to see what we have here.

516
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,310
And this is exactly what
we expect to be seeing,

517
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,660
the sinc-like distribution.

518
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,030
The height there is
256, as it should be.

519
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,910
That's the N. And then
this should be at 2 pi

520
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,910
over capital N. If you
translate that to what it means

521
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:05,370
in actual frequency, this first
null there is at 187.5 Hertz.

522
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,140
That's 48 kilohertz
divided by N, so that's--

523
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,200
OK, so that's that number.

524
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
So that gives you some
idea of how this thing is

525
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,550
spread in frequency.

526
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,840
OK, so if this pulse is applied
directly to the loudspeaker--

527
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,450
well, here, the
loudspeaker passband

528
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,890
goes from about 100 Hertz
to, let's say, 10,000 Hertz.

529
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,460
You see there's huge
amounts of the energy that's

530
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,180
not in the passband
of the loudspeaker.

531
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,680
All right?

532
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,470
So this is not going to do very
well if you just directly apply

533
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,990
that pulse to the loudspeaker.

534
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,073
You have to match the
frequency content of the input

535
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,990
to the frequency response
of the system you're

536
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,540
trying to get this over.

537
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,040
OK.

538
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,950
Now, just as an
experiment before we

539
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,890
get back to sending this
across a loudspeaker,

540
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,560
let's take a look
at what happens

541
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,392
if we send that rectangular
pulse over a lowpass channel.

542
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:19,100
So let's save the
bandpass channel, which

543
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,610
is a little more
involved, for later,

544
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,720
and just look at
what happens if we

545
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,120
send this pulse over
a lowpass channel.

546
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,710
So I'm thinking about a
channel whose frequency

547
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,450
characteristic--

548
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,320
this is h of omega--

549
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,120
it passes low
frequencies, and then it

550
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,321
truncates higher frequencies.

551
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,900
OK?

552
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,200
And what I'm going to
do is send in an x of N,

553
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,440
which is this pulse in time.

554
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,410
256 at height 1, and
then everything 0.

555
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,430
All right, so if I'm thinking
of it in the frequency domain,

556
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,097
then I take the spectral content
of the signal, which we've just

557
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:13,990
worked out, and multiplied
by the frequency response

558
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,470
characteristic, which
just basically selects out

559
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,600
the frequency content
that's in the passband

560
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,550
and rejects everything else.

561
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,460
And then that gives me the
spectral content of the output,

562
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,820
and I can translate
that back to what

563
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,060
happens in the time domain.

564
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,160
So here is-- well, actually,
let's take a zoomed-in version.

565
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:39,040
I've taken a lowpass filter,
where this cutoff corresponds

566
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,960
to actually a
cutoff at 400 Hertz

567
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,740
if you're thinking in terms
of the underlying waveform.

568
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,850
So what we've done is take
the rectangular pulse,

569
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,230
put it through a
lowpass filter--

570
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,020
and I'm assuming an
ideal lowpass filter--

571
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,860
passes everything in this
frequency band and nothing

572
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,680
outside of it, OK?

573
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,780
So here again, we see
we're selecting out

574
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,640
part of the spectral
structure of the input,

575
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,010
but there's huge
amounts of the energy

576
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,410
of the input that
are being left out

577
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,450
of the output of the filter.

578
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,400
Now, in the time domain, look
at what this corresponds to.

579
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,790
It's an approximation
to this pulse,

580
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,132
but it's one in which all the
high-frequency content has

581
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:23,590
disappeared because we've only
let the low-frequency pieces

582
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,250
through.

583
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,450
So what you have is a very
rounded kind of pulse.

584
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:34,450
It spreads out well over the 256
mark, so here's the 0 to 256,

585
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,200
but this thing actually spills
over into adjacent bit slots.

586
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,850
We've taken out the
high-frequency components,

587
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,370
so it can't make any
sharp turns anymore.

588
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,900
It's got this
lower-frequency wiggling.

589
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,040
As you can imagine, if I
made this even smaller,

590
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,520
my wiggling would become
even more leisurely here,

591
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,767
and I would spill further into
the adjacent bit slots, OK?

592
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,350
So this is what
lowpass filtering will

593
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,810
do to that rectangular pulse.

594
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,880
Any questions on this piece?

595
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,310
OK.

596
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:15,630
Now, we've actually seen
examples of this type.

597
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,140
I flashed these up last time.

598
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,230
It's the same idea, except it
was not just a single pulse.

599
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,838
It was a succession
of pulses like this.

600
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:25,130
So you could do the same thing.

601
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,500
Have a succession
of pulses like this.

602
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,520
Take its DTFT to assess
the spectral content.

603
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,520
I'm showing you not actually the
DTFT but something proportional

604
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,180
to it here.

605
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,690
This is-- so ignore
the labels there.

606
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,550
Think of this as
essentially the DTFT.

607
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,770
To within the
scale factor it is.

608
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:47,120
So you can see that I
have spectral content

609
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,210
all the way out to the edges.

610
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,310
But now send it through
a lowpass channel

611
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,040
which zeros out all
the spectral content

612
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,415
outside of some central
region, and what

613
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:58,790
you have coming
out the other end

614
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,560
is something that can't take
the sharp turns anymore,

615
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,410
so it's much more rounded.

616
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,330
And as you narrow it
down still further,

617
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,870
you get even more rounding,
and you get a spilling over.

618
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,170
You see this sharply confined
rectangular pulse now spills

619
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,500
over into the adjacent slots.

620
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,600
And you can go still
further on that.

621
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,880
The top plot here is the
same as the bottom plot

622
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,560
in the previous one.

623
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,270
But this is just
showing the sequence.

624
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,350
So as you narrow it down
further and further and further,

625
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,990
what comes out
the other end gets

626
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,400
much less distinctive
in its features, OK?

627
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,370
It can only-- this only has
very low-frequency content,

628
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,380
so it can't do any sharp turns.

629
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,010
And this is an eye
diagram corresponding to--

630
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,140
in each of these
received signals-- just

631
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,113
to show you how
detection gets difficult

632
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,030
if you've got a lowpass
channel and you've got

633
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,050
this pulse that's
not well-defined.

634
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,240
Now, how might you actually--

635
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,520
how might you get a
better-defined pulse

636
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,580
for a given channel?

637
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,020
So if I gave you this channel--

638
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,685
we sent in this pulse
of length 256 samples,

639
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,810
and we got something that
we didn't like because it

640
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,057
spilled over into other slots.

641
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,640
The reason it spilled
into other slots

642
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,480
is we were cutting out too
much of its spectral content.

643
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,540
What could you do to this
pulse to get more of its energy

644
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,890
across that bandpass channel?

645
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,180
Yeah?

646
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,680
Sorry?

647
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,120
AUDIENCE: Set a longer pulse.

648
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,698
PROFESSOR: Set a longer pulse.

649
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:32,490
How does that work?

650
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,440
Now, you see, if
you make N longer,

651
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,680
you make the pulse longer, you
shrink this correspondingly

652
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,270
in the frequency domain, right?

653
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:47,120
We said that on these
sinc-type characteristics,

654
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,890
the height was N.
This first null was

655
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,550
2 pi over N. Make
the pulse longer,

656
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,430
you pull the main lobe in
tighter, and more of this

657
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,780
is going to go through, OK?

658
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,630
And you can see that clearly.

659
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,160
That's something you can
explore in your experiment.

660
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,630
So if you wanted to get
more clearly defined

661
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:11,703
output for a given
lowpass channel,

662
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:13,870
you might want to increase
the length of your pulse.

663
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,245
Of course, that's going to
slow down your signaling rate,

664
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,090
so there's a trade-off
involved, right?

665
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,680
Now, we've actually--
this is just

666
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,190
to sort of step back and point
out that what we're seeing here

667
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,510
are some properties that are
inherent to Fourier transforms,

668
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,010
OK?

669
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,310
So it's typically the
case that if you've

670
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,155
got a signal that's wide in
time, it's narrow in frequency.

671
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,530
And if you make
it wider in time,

672
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,670
it gets narrower in frequency.

673
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,630
In fact, as I mentioned
up there, the uncertainty

674
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,150
principle in physics really
comes from this result.

675
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:59,130
It says that the spread in time
times the spread in frequency

676
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,330
has some lower bound, OK?

677
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,270
So this is some number
that's strictly positive.

678
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,260
So you can't make a signal
arbitrarily concentrated

679
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,020
in time and concentrated
in frequency.

680
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,550
If you make one
small, the other one

681
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,438
will have to grow
correspondingly.

682
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:15,480
So actually, the uncertainty
principle in physics

683
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,040
is precisely a theorem
in Fourier transforms

684
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,350
if you study it.

685
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,260
Here is another such
complementarity or duality.

686
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,500
The smoother you make a
signal in time, the more sharp

687
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,590
it is in frequency.

688
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,090
Let's see.

689
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,840
We saw that here,
for instance, right?

690
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,840
We had a signal in time,
namely the unit sample

691
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,150
response of the ideal filter.

692
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,050
This was-- this didn't
have any sharp edges to it.

693
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,820
It was a sinc function.

694
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,219
You got something
that's smooth in time,

695
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,313
it ends up having sharp
edges in frequency, OK?

696
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:52,980
And the more smooth
you make it in time,

697
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,313
the sharper it
gets in frequency.

698
00:34:56,313 --> 00:34:57,480
And this we've already seen.

699
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,030
This is the kind of trade-off
we're talking about.

700
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,280
So these are characteristics
to be on the lookout for.

701
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,310
In fact, I just did a
little experiment here.

702
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,090
What if we decided not to try
and send a rectangular pulse

703
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,000
over, but we smoothed out
the pulse a little bit

704
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
to get rid of that sharp edge?

705
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,630
So that's another way
that you can try and get

706
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,735
a pulse over a lowpass
channel like this.

707
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:27,110
So you see, what
I'm trying to do

708
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,740
is not have the sharp
discontinuities, the 0 to 1

709
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,000
and the 1 to 0.

710
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,460
I want a more rounded
behavior in the time domain

711
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,950
so I get a sharper concentration
in the frequency domain,

712
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,850
and you can actually
see how that works.

713
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:54,180
So what I've actually done here
is, instead of a signal that--

714
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,770
well, if you'll
permit me, I don't

715
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,010
want to draw these stem
plots, the lollipop figures,

716
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,000
because they get painful
to draw, but just assume

717
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,460
that this is 256 such things.

718
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,220
That's the rectangular pulse
we were trying to send before.

719
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,320
What I've done now
is instead say,

720
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,880
well, let me around
the edges, so I'm

721
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,160
going to have a half cycle of
a cosine for that edge, OK?

722
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,870
So that's what--
these are the samples

723
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,760
I'm going to use at
this edge, and I'm

724
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,640
going to have a half-cycle
of a cosine at this edge.

725
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,820
This is actually something
that's used quite a bit

726
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,898
in applications.

727
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:30,190
All right, so what have I done?

728
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,690
I've removed the
sharp edge and gotten

729
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,860
a much-rounded transition.

730
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,330
In fact, if you're thinking
of continuous functions,

731
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,610
the original had
a discontinuity,

732
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,920
whereas here I've got to
take two derivatives before I

733
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,430
encounter a discontinuity
because the function itself

734
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,943
and its slope at these
ends are well-matched,

735
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:51,360
so I've got to
differentiate twice

736
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,630
before I get a discontinuity.

737
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,160
So actually, it has quite
some smoothness to it.

738
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,980
Smooth in time means
more tightly concentrated

739
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,000
in frequency.

740
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,050
So all I'm doing
on the next slide

741
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,440
is showing you, so
your eye can compare,

742
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,160
what the spectral content
is of the original pulse

743
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,438
and of this rounded pulse.

744
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:14,980
And for the rounded
pulse, I actually

745
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,810
just flipped it over so that
you can compare more easily.

746
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,250
So this is the negative
of the DTFT magnitude

747
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,140
of the shaped pulse.

748
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,690
And you can sort of
see right away here

749
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,000
that the frequency content
has essentially settled out.

750
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,230
It's almost all contained
in this smaller region,

751
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,590
whereas the
rectangular pulse had

752
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,160
a frequency content that went
way off to high frequencies,

753
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,660
right?

754
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,250
Went off to 24 kilohertz,
for instance, in our example.

755
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,065
So the frequency content
of the shaped pulse

756
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,690
is much more tightly
contained, and you

757
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,398
have a much better
chance of getting that

758
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,480
across a lowpass channel.

759
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,470
So this is just a
little bit of shaping

760
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,570
that can make a big
difference in terms

761
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,480
of adapting the signal you're
trying to send to the channel.

762
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,020
So if I look in the time
domain, sending these two

763
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,740
pulses over the same
lowpass channel,

764
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,780
you can do a visual
comparison of what comes out.

765
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,300
So here's the original 256
rectangular pulse coming out

766
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,950
the other end.

767
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,770
Here is my shaped pulse
coming out the other end.

768
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,980
And you can see the shaped pulse
is much more tightly confined

769
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,600
in the bit slot that
I assigned to it,

770
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,420
so it's much more
tightly confined

771
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,040
around the 256-sample width, OK?

772
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,697
So this is another
thing that is done,

773
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:34,780
and it's done by thinking
in the frequency domain.

774
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,360
People designed
these pulses thinking

775
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
in the frequency domain.

776
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,250
They're not doing convolution.

777
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,160
OK, that was all
lowpass, but we want

778
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,075
to look at bandpass, so just a
couple of quick examples there.

779
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,325
So we're back to the speakers.

780
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,460
And we're taking our
rectangular pulse

781
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,590
and applying it to the speaker.

782
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,630
So here's what the spectrum
looks like after ideal bandpass

783
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,130
filtering.

784
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,590
So I'm not actually
filtering with the speaker

785
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,550
characteristic.

786
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,860
I'm assuming an
ideal bandpass that

787
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,650
extends from 100
Hertz to 10,000 Hertz

788
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,450
and zeros out everything
outside that range.

789
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,950
So I send in the
spectral characteristic

790
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,890
of my rectangular pulse.

791
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,880
I shape it with the bandpass.

792
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,680
So what comes out is
something that has

793
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,982
this spectral characteristic.

794
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,190
And you can see that the
frequency content is sharply

795
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:32,400
limited 10 kilohertz
above 0, and then there

796
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,010
is actually a central region
that's entirely missing.

797
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,820
So remember, this had to
go originally up to 256,

798
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,780
but because we've chopped
out the center portion,

799
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,410
we're only going out to
150-something out there.

800
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,910
So actually, if I
zoom in, you can

801
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,500
see that a lot more closely.

802
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,920
So this is a zoomed-in
version of what

803
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,340
comes out from a loudspeaker,
from a bandpass filter,

804
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,830
if I send in a
rectangular pulse.

805
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,512
The very low frequencies
are entirely missing,

806
00:40:03,512 --> 00:40:05,220
and we saw in the
previous characteristic

807
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,260
that the very high frequencies
are missing, as well.

808
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,750
So what's the shape of the
pulse that you get out?

809
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,630
Not very good.

810
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,370
Because the low
frequencies are missing,

811
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,620
this thing tends to
sag in the middle.

812
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,160
It can't hold up DC.

813
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,680
And it can't make the very
sharp transitions, either,

814
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,550
so there is a more
leisurely transition.

815
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,060
But again, this can't
stay at that level.

816
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,040
It actually asymptotes.

817
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,530
So the actual pulse occupies--
before it settles, occupies way

818
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,760
over the 256 bits that
I've allotted to it, OK?

819
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,310
So taking that rectangular
pulse and directly putting it

820
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,090
on the speaker is going to
give you something not pretty

821
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,270
at the other end and something
that you cannot signal with.

822
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:58,140
So the question is what
to do about that, OK?

823
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,552
And the answer to that is this
thing that we call modulation.

824
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:04,260
We've already seen it
in different forms.

825
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:10,240
Let's think about it now
in the frequency domain.

826
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,130
OK, so here's what
we're going to do.

827
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,400
Want the big stick of chalk.

828
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,900
OK.

829
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,717
We're going to shape the
spectral characteristics

830
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:30,300
of the signal.

831
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,600
We started off with some
time-domain signal links, x N,

832
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,920
corresponding DTFT x omega.

833
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,010
It wasn't well-matched to
our channel characteristics,

834
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:46,600
and so what we're
going to do is multiply

835
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,260
by some carrier frequency.

836
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,150
And this is simple
amplitude modulation.

837
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,790
We're just referring to
it as modulation here.

838
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,740
We get some signal out here.

839
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,720
And the question is, what is
the frequency characteristic

840
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,226
of that signal?

841
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:18,990
OK, we've already seen
what the frequency

842
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,355
characteristic of the input is.

843
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:23,480
What's the frequency
characteristic of that signal?

844
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,260
So just to give you an
example, we had our x of omega

845
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,800
looking something
like the sinc shape.

846
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,570
Remember height N there?

847
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,180
And the question is, what's
the spectrum of this?

848
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,980
And there's a
computation up there

849
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,560
that I don't want to go
through, but it shows you

850
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,510
that the answer is
actually quite simple.

851
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,120
So if I call this--

852
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,567
let me call this t
of N because it's

853
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,025
the signal we're
going to transmit.

854
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,510
Here's what the spectrum of the
transmitted signal looks like.

855
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,870
There is omega.

856
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,430
There's pi.

857
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,560
Here's omega c.

858
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,800
OK, so the
prescription is simple.

859
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,430
Take the spectral characteristic
and replicate it at omega c

860
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,640
and replicate it at minus
omega c, and scale by 1/2.

861
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,310
So what you're going to get
is this characteristic here,

862
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:57,680
this characteristic here, and
the height will be N over 2.

863
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,580
It's that simple.

864
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,347
So you can go through the math.

865
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,180
When you're done with
the math, what it says

866
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,310
is that the spectral
characteristic

867
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,260
of this modulated signal is
the spectral characteristic

868
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,550
of the envelope of the baseband
signal, or the envelope,

869
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,642
but translated to the
position of the carrier.

870
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:19,100
So you can begin
to see how this is

871
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,980
going to help us shift
a signal to get it

872
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,323
across a bandpass channel.

873
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:24,740
We started off
with something that

874
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,370
was not well-suited to the
loudspeaker we now have a way

875
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,740
to shift its energy
to get it right

876
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,170
in the passband of the
speaker by picking the carrier

877
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,830
frequency appropriately.

878
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,330
All right?

879
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,370
I think I'm going to
skip some of this.

880
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,060
But let's look at
what this does.

881
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,560
It's really this
picture, but I just

882
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,520
want to show you how it
works with actual waveforms.

883
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,650
So here is the rectangular
pulse times the cosine.

884
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,270
I've picked-- what did I pick?

885
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,120
1 kilohertz as my carrier?

886
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,210
Yeah.

887
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,280
1,000 Hertz was the carrier.

888
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,400
1,000 Hertz sits comfortably
in the passband of a speaker,

889
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,780
so it's a reasonable choice.

890
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,480
By the way, in typical AM,
the carrier frequencies

891
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,458
are much higher
than-- or the ratio

892
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:17,500
of the carrier frequency
to the rate of variation

893
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,387
of the envelope is
much higher than what

894
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,470
we have in these examples.

895
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,060
So the audio channel is
actually very challenging.

896
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,060
OK, so this is my
modulated signal.

897
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,130
The question is, what does
its spectrum look like?

898
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,660
So I run it through
the FFT, and indeed I

899
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,470
get the replication here.

900
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,970
Let's zoom in a
little bit so we can

901
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,178
see it a little more closely.

902
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,390
So what I have is those
two sinc-like spectral

903
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,440
characteristics, but translated
to sit centered at 1,000

904
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,240
Hertz and minus 1,000 Hertz.

905
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,270
Remember that this
is 0 out here, OK?

906
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,770
And the height,
well, it's now it's

907
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,980
128, which is half the
256 that I had before.

908
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,720
So in terms of positioning
this within where

909
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,680
the loudspeaker
will transmit it,

910
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,935
we were taking the lower
cutoff of the loudspeaker

911
00:46:20,935 --> 00:46:22,900
as being around 100 Hertz.

912
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,920
This is where 100 Hertz sits.

913
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,350
So you can see
that a huge amount

914
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,730
of the energy of the
pulse is getting through.

915
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,980
It's at the wrong frequencies.

916
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,300
We'll have to deal
with getting it back.

917
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,300
But at least getting the energy
across is working here, OK?

918
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,927
And the upper cutoff of the
speaker is way off over here.

919
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:40,510
So this is 10,000,
but I'm showing you

920
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:45,520
a zoomed-in version, so the
upper frequency is way off.

921
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,650
In fact, that also
brings up the idea

922
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,830
that you could actually do
this trick multiple times.

923
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,470
You could actually pick another
carrier frequency somewhat

924
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,517
higher than this with some
other modulating signal on it

925
00:46:56,517 --> 00:46:57,850
and tuck that in there, as well.

926
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,790
So you could simultaneously
transmit messages

927
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,190
on multiple carriers
through that same speaker,

928
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,210
and you'll be exploring
that, as well.

929
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,710
OK.

930
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,960
So what does the-- what's
the time-domain signal that

931
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,490
corresponds to this looks like?

932
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,650
So when you get it, you
impress this modulated signal

933
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,830
on the loudspeaker, on
this bandpass filter.

934
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,760
What's the output of
the bandpass filter?

935
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,390
You can see it's almost
exactly what you put in, OK?

936
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,300
There's a little
bit of distortion

937
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,290
at the different places,
but it's basically exactly

938
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,000
the pulse that you put in.

939
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,340
So almost all the
energy has gone through,

940
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,280
and you don't have
significant distortion

941
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,200
because you've squarely
placed the energy

942
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,580
in the passband of the filter.

943
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,880
OK, now how do we recover?

944
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,470
How do we get back the
original baseband signal?

945
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,970
Well, it turns out
it's very easy.

946
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,800
Let me actually
do it in pictures,

947
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,030
and then we'll look at the math.

948
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,940
This is what's coming
in to our receiver,

949
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,140
and now we've got to process
this to get back a signal that

950
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,850
has this spectrum.

951
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,010
We've learned a trick,
which is modulation.

952
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,680
Multiply it by a cosine,
and you'll take the spectrum

953
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,257
and replicate it at omega
c and at minus omega c.

954
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:23,840
I'm going to use the
same trick again.

955
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,130
I'm going to take the
received signal multiplied

956
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,010
by a cosine of the
same carrier frequency,

957
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,300
and what's that going to do?

958
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,500
Well, my scale is getting
bigger here each time.

959
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:45,180
So here's my omega c.

960
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,640
Here's my minus omega c.

961
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,520
What's coming in is this signal.

962
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,890
I'm going to multiply it
by cosine omega c, so what

963
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,510
does that do in the spectrum?

964
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:58,770
It takes this spectrum,
replicates it at omega c.

965
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,890
So what does that do?

966
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:05,330
Well, it puts a piece here,
and it puts a piece here,

967
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,580
at 2 omega c, right?

968
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,612
Because I've taken
this spectrum--

969
00:49:11,612 --> 00:49:13,320
you've got to imagine
the change of scale

970
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,760
so I can draw all of this.

971
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,320
I've taken this
spectrum and I've

972
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,800
placed it centered on omega c.

973
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,270
And this is now--

974
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,845
this is the N over 2 here.

975
00:49:22,845 --> 00:49:24,720
Oh, but now it's going
to be N over 4, right?

976
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,140
Because I divide by 2.

977
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,840
And then I take
the same spectrum

978
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,630
and I center it
on minus omega c.

979
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,440
OK, so I've got
the N over 4 piece

980
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,250
here, but I'm going
to have the other--

981
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,080
oh, sorry.

982
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,610
I drew it in the wrong place.

983
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,520
I'm going to center
it at omega c.

984
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,590
So this is going to end
up at minus 2 omega c.

985
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,280
And the replication here.

986
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,380
So there's going to be a second
one sitting here at the origin.

987
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,190
So the net effect
at the origin is

988
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:10,460
that I get the original
spectrum, but scaled by a half,

989
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,360
and then I get vestiges
of this, if you like,

990
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,188
centered at twice the
carrier frequency, OK?

991
00:50:18,188 --> 00:50:19,980
And that's actually
what the algebra shows.

992
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,290
The algebra is very simple.

993
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,700
You're receiving this.

994
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,720
Multiply it again by a cosine.

995
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,870
So take the received signal and
multiply it again by a cosine.

996
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:33,290
Well, if you substitute for
what the received signal is,

997
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,380
you get x n times
cosine squared.

998
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,110
Cosine squared, if you
use a standard identity,

999
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,595
splits into these two terms.

1000
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,640
Let's see.

1001
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,610
Do I have that right?

1002
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,250
Yeah.

1003
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:52,100
So here's the 0.5 x n
sitting here at the origin,

1004
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,210
and here's another term,
which is x n times the cosine.

1005
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,420
So this is like a
modulated signal,

1006
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,030
but modulated by twice
the carrier frequency.

1007
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,060
So what does this translate to?

1008
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,730
Well, it's actually 0.5 times
x n times cosine 2 omega c.

1009
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,890
What does that do in
the spectral domain?

1010
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,190
It's going to take half of
that and place it at minus 2

1011
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,410
omega c and plus 2 omega
c, so it's completely

1012
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,310
consistent with this picture.

1013
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,310
So what is it that we
have to do now to extract

1014
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,268
the signal of interest?

1015
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,920
Just a lowpass
filtering here, OK?

1016
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,850
So if you can select out this
piece with a lowpass filter,

1017
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,800
you've recovered the
signal of interest.

1018
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,570
You can adjust the
scale factor, too,

1019
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,470
so you can have a lowpass
filter with a gain of 2

1020
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,320
and you've recovered
your original signal.

1021
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,410
All right, we'll
build on Monday.

1022
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,380
And that'll be the last
lecture on this material.

1023
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,150
Relative to the calendar,
we're just sliding forward,

1024
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,210
so we'll wrap up
this stuff on Monday

1025
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,830
and then continue with packets.
