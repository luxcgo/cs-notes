GEORGE VERGHESE: I
want to actually spend

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,500
a little time, not
too much, talking

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,690
about discrete-time
Fourier transforms

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,290
versus discrete-time
Fourier series.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,210
You don't have any
basis for comparison,

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,850
but I think the way we've
told the spectral content

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,690
story this term is quite a bit
simpler than in previous terms,

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,390
but that leaves you puzzling
over chunks of the notes

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,050
and practice problems that refer
to the discrete-time Fourier

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,150
series and to periodic
signals and so on.

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,510
So I just wanted to give you
a little insight into that,

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,230
and then we'll go on to
talk about modulation

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,480
and demodulation some more.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,360
OK, so we've seen that
our interest is generally

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,710
in signals of finite duration
because practical computation

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,850
has to deal with that.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,810
And so we've got
signals of this form--

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,200
0 outside of some window,
and really without loss

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,250
of generality, I can take
it to be some window from 0

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,150
to L minus 1.

28
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,860
If the signal shifts
in time, we know

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,260
what to do with the
Fourier transform.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,600
Can you hear me all right,
by the way, at the back?

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,210
Yeah, OK.

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,330
All right so if we've
got non-zero values only

33
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,310
over a finite range,
then the computation

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,430
of the discrete-time
Fourier transform boils

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,640
down to a simple
finite computation.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,850
Now, what we'll typically
do is give ourselves

37
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,070
a little more flexibility.

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,770
Since the signal is 0 outside
of this interval anyway,

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,050
we might sometimes
allow ourselves

40
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,680
to think of the signal as
being longer, but still

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,660
with zeros out here.

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,520
So you might come all the
way up to some P minus 1.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,360
And what we're saying is, this
is the window of interest.

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,150
Everywhere outside of this
window, the signal is 0.

45
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,730
Now, the signal can be 0 at
various points inside here,

46
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,670
as well, but what we're saying
is, outside of this interval,

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,380
the signal is 0.

48
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,630
Therefore, I only need
to compute this from 0

49
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,230
to P minus 1, all right?

50
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,320
And the nice thing
is, it turns out

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,040
that you can actually recover
the time-domain signals

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,450
from the samples of the
DTFT through the formula

53
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,900
on the right side.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,690
So what we're doing
is we're actually

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,380
computing the DTFT
just at isolated

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,710
points on the axis
between minus pi and pi,

57
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,430
just P, capital P, points.

58
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,935
Or you can think of them as
points on the unit circle that

59
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,810
correspond to each of
those exponentials that

60
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,820
appear in the Fourier
transform definition.

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,420
And we then recover the
time-domain signals just

62
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,280
from those samples, OK?

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,640
And really what's driving this
is the fact that the signal is

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,180
0 outside of a finite window.

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,850
OK.

66
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,017
We'll also typically-- and
if you look in the books,

67
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:29,450
you'll see this, as well--

68
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,560
this notation often gets
simplified, so x of omega sub k

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,540
gets simplified to just x sub k.

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,240
It's the k-th
spectral coefficient.

71
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,200
All right, so all that is good.

72
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,630
And we have this nice algorithm
for computing things, which

73
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,920
is the fast Fourier transform.

74
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,980
So we talked about
how that significantly

75
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,410
reduces computation.

76
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,240
Now, there are properties
of these formulas

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,585
that you can explore, and
I have some listed here.

78
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm not going to
go through them.

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,585
They're essentially
the same properties

80
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:08,280
we've seen for the DTFT.

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,870
I want to focus more on this
formula for reconstruction

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,399
of the time signal from
the spectral coefficients.

83
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,269
By the way, in a previous
writing of this formula,

84
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,020
I had written the upper
limit as P over 2.

85
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,700
It's actually P over
2 minus 1, so I'll

86
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,080
fix that in the earlier slides.

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,840
OK, so what you're guaranteed is
that if you apply that formula,

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,790
you will recover every signal
value in this window of length

89
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,070
capital P. But what happens
outside of that window?

90
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,470
Well, if you look
at this expression,

91
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,730
is the right-hand
side here periodic?

92
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,970
You should suspect that it
is because of the e to the j

93
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,460
something n is there, right?

94
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,310
If you look at the
definition of omega sub k

95
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,840
and look at each of these terms,
it turns out that each of these

96
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,240
will repeat periodically
with period 2 pi.

97
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,300
Sorry, with period-- let's see.

98
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,520
I've said it badly.

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,130
This whole term will repeat
when n increases by capital P,

100
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,630
all right?

101
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,420
So let me write it down.

102
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,040
And why is that?

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:37,630
Well, omega sub
k is 2 pi over P.

104
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,940
So if you increase
time by capital P,

105
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,890
you're going to increase
the exponent by 2 pi,

106
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,470
and you've got the same
exponential back again.

107
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,610
And you can do this for any
integer multiple of capital P.

108
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,753
So what that tells you
is that the expression

109
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:53,170
on the right-hand
side is actually

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,180
going to repeat periodically
outside of this interval.

111
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,190
So it's fine to use
this formula to recover

112
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,310
the values in this
window, but if you start

113
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,900
to evaluate this formula
outside of that window,

114
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,040
you're going to start getting
this whole thing repeated

115
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,467
periodically, so
you're going to get--

116
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:12,550
at this point you'll get--

117
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,980
and so on, OK?

118
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,080
So the formula doesn't
know what to do except

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,550
to replicate periodically.

120
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,400
It's up to you to know
that this formula is

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,560
no good outside of this window.

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,268
All right?

123
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,060
There's another way to
think of it, though,

124
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,560
which is that this
formula gives you

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,230
a nice, compact representation
for a periodic signal.

126
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,850
So if you started off
with a periodic signal,

127
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,230
here's a way to represent it
as just a sum of capital P

128
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,870
exponentials, and that's
what a Fourier series is.

129
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,140
So you've seen in
1803 or other places,

130
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,507
in continuous time I
imagine, that if you

131
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,340
had a periodic signal
you could represent it

132
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,320
with a Fourier series.

133
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,990
This is actually
a Fourier series

134
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,527
for this periodic signal.

135
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,360
But if you know that
your action of interest

136
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,728
is all in this finite
interval within one period,

137
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,770
then you can actually use
the Fourier series just

138
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,960
to study what goes on
in that one interval

139
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,997
without worrying
about what's outside.

140
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,830
And that's really what
we've done this term,

141
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,230
is we've kind of ignored
periodic signals.

142
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,160
We've said all the attention
is in a finite interval.

143
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,820
Within that interval, we have
this Fourier representation.

144
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,370
It's easily computed by the FFT,
and everything works nicely.

145
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,720
So just to give a concrete
illustration of how we end up

146
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,150
applying this in a
particular situation that

147
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,580
should be familiar, if I had an
input going into an LTI system

148
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,200
producing an output, and if the
input was non-zero only from 0

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,000
to, let's say some n sub
x, and if the unit sample

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,340
response of the system was
zero only from 0 to n sub h,

151
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,110
is there a particular
interval of time

152
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,300
that you can
guarantee for me will

153
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,990
contain all the non-zero
values of the output?

154
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,320
I want you to find for
me an interval outside

155
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,690
of which the output
is guaranteed to be 0.

156
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,460
Anybody?

157
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,749
Yeah?

158
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,083
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

159
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,250
GEORGE VERGHESE: Yeah, good.

160
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:44,960
There are many ways
to think of this.

161
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:55,240
One is to say, well, the
input value at time 0

162
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,680
fires off a unit
sample of duration,

163
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,790
goes from 0 to n sub h, and
then the input value at time 1

164
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,200
fires off a unit sample response
that starts one time later,

165
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,020
and so on.

166
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,370
So each of these fires off
a unit sample response.

167
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,280
Well, you've got
inputs extending from 0

168
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,800
to n x, and so
you're going to have

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,083
an output that extends from
0 to n x plus n h, all right?

170
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,250
So you're guaranteed that
all the action of interest

171
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,380
happens in this finite interval.

172
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,750
And given that that's the
case, you can actually--

173
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,090
whoops, what happened?

174
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,230
You can actually do this kind
of spectral representation,

175
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,760
use the FFT, and all of that.

176
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,810
You're going to just work
on a finite interval, 0

177
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,450
to P minus 1, defined by that
or greater than that, OK?

178
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,090
So this is actually one of the
most frequent uses of the FFT.

179
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,360
It's to study systems where
all the action happens

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,003
in a finite window and
you know a priori what

181
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:01,920
the length of that window
is, and you can then

182
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,517
do all your computations there.

183
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:05,100
And you never look
outside that window

184
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,290
because you've already
guaranteed that everything

185
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,892
of interest happens there.

186
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,350
But when you read
the notes, you'll

187
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,110
find it's essentially
the same story,

188
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,852
but when you talk
about Fourier series

189
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,810
you're actually talking
about the whole signal,

190
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,360
the periodic signal, all right?

191
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:27,420
One bit of notation, also,
as you're reading the notes,

192
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,010
just to go back a second here.

193
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,670
We've been working
entirely in terms

194
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,090
of these samples of the DTFT.

195
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,610
When you're thinking of
Fourier series, when you're

196
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,310
thinking of this as
a Fourier series,

197
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,760
it's typical to write
X omega k over P

198
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,170
as just the Fourier
coefficient, A sub k.

199
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,620
So you'll see in the
notes an A sub k.

200
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,100
That's just a normalized
version of the Fourier transform

201
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,860
sample, OK?

202
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,700
All right.

203
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,500
That's as much as I
wanted to say on this,

204
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,560
so let's get back to
talking about modulation

205
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,530
and demodulation.

206
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,480
If you have questions
on what I talked about,

207
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,210
you can bring them
up in recitation.

208
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,420
All right, so just to
review where we are.

209
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,435
We've got some signal,
x of n at baseband.

210
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
Baseband just means that
its frequency content

211
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,290
is centered around zero.

212
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,220
You've not done any
modulation or shifting yet.

213
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,290
You've been allotted some
part of the frequency axis

214
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,720
to do your transmission in
because someone's told you,

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,120
perhaps, that the medium
that you're going to use

216
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,580
can only transmit in
that range, or the FCC

217
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,370
has decreed that you're only
going to use that region.

218
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,450
So you want to send
that signal somehow

219
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,730
in another frequency band.

220
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,530
So modulation was
a process by which

221
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,070
we converted up to
some carrier frequency,

222
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,500
and then demodulation was
what you did with the receiver

223
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,230
to get back down.

224
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,090
So just to look at that
in a little more detail.

225
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,740
This is the modulation process
we talked about last time.

226
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,420
You've got a time-domain
signal, your information signal.

227
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,760
You multiply it by
the cosine to get

228
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,990
an amplitude-modulated
transmitted signal.

229
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,870
So t of n is the signal
that you transmit, OK?

230
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,530
There are other names for this.

231
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,590
This process of
multiplying a signal

232
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,840
by a cosine at a
particular frequency

233
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,700
is referred to as heterodyning.

234
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,840
That's a term from the earliest
days of Amplitude Modulation,

235
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,000
I think invented by Fessenden,
who also invented AM,

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,380
and of course it's specifically
amplitude modulation for us.

237
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,960
All right, so just
to think spectrally,

238
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,370
we had a simplified version
of this picture last time,

239
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,530
but let's first assume that this
signal has some spectrum, which

240
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,660
is shown by a cartoon here.

241
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm assuming a real signal.

242
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,200
So we know that the spectrum
has a real part that's even

243
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,180
and an imaginary
part that's odd,

244
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,180
and that's what's shown for
you here on this figure, OK?

245
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,430
So we're going to track
the spectrum of the signal

246
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,030
by tracking the real and
imaginary parts separately

247
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,490
because the spectrum is in
general a complex function

248
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,627
of frequency.

249
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:22,210
We've seen last time
what happens when

250
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,470
you multiply by the cosine.

251
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,540
You take the spectrum,
and you replicate it

252
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,800
at the locations of the carrier.

253
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,240
So if your carrier
frequency is omega c,

254
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,910
here's your frequency
band, going from minus pi

255
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,610
somewhere there to
plus pi somewhere here.

256
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,660
You've got a plus and minus
omega c, the carrier frequency.

257
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,540
So what happens
when you modulate

258
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,780
is you take the spectrum
and you plunk it down

259
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,050
on plus omega c
and minus omega c,

260
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,340
and you scale by 1/2, all right?

261
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,880
So if the real part
had amplitude a before,

262
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,000
it now has amplitude a over
2, and the imaginary part,

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,260
similarly.

264
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,690
I haven't drawn these to
scale, but hopefully the labels

265
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,790
are clear enough.

266
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,530
OK, so the modulation
is not simple

267
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,650
when you're thinking of what it
does in the frequency domain.

268
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:18,500
Now, it is not simple, but this
picture is a little deceptive,

269
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,670
perhaps, because I made an
implicit assumption here.

270
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,060
Otherwise, the picture
would be a bit messier.

271
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,200
What am I relying on here
to get this simple picture?

272
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,020
Yeah?

273
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,520
Sorry?

274
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,467
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

275
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,550
GEORGE VERGHESE: Centered?

276
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,550
What's centered at zero?

277
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,280
Oh, the spectrum here?

278
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,320
OK, yeah, the spectrum
centered at here

279
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,880
gives me a simple picture, yeah.

280
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

281
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,670
GEORGE VERGHESE: OK, exactly.

282
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,830
You see, when I
drew this here, you

283
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,780
can still recognize
the triangles that

284
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,580
came from over there.

285
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,790
But if the baseband signal
had a frequency content that

286
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,020
extended way over, then
the replication that I have

287
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,720
here would actually leak
into the replication

288
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,280
that I have there, and I get
a more complicated picture,

289
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,780
all right?

290
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,640
So if you want the
simple picture,

291
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,220
you actually have to limit
the frequency content

292
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,990
of your baseband signal, OK?

293
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,900
You can see here,
if the signal only

294
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,410
extends omega c on
either side, then I'm OK.

295
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,630
The two replications will
not smear into each other,

296
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,130
all right?

297
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,640
So we need a limit on
the frequency content.

298
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,470
Now, the specific
limit that you have

299
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,580
depends on the application.

300
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,580
We'll see later when you
do frequency-division

301
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,955
multiplexing,
where you're trying

302
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:34,860
to put many different signals
in the same general frequency

303
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,090
band, that the restrictions
might be different.

304
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,970
But the basic idea
is this, that you

305
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,090
want any replication
of your signal,

306
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,640
if you're going to extract it
later on downstream somewhere,

307
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,830
you want the replication to not
be corrupted by images of it

308
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,930
somewhere else, or images
of some other signal.

309
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,830
So actually, the example
that I showed you last time

310
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,780
wasn't perfect in
that regard, right?

311
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,410
Remember, this was the spectrum
of our typical baseband.

312
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,180
We had 256 samples,
like this, and then 0's.

313
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,920
And we looked at the
spectral content.

314
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,560
It was given by a
sinc-like function,

315
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,330
and this is the spectral content
magnitude after modulation,

316
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,530
and therefore it's
the two replicas.

317
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,920
I'd modulated this onto
a 1,000 Hertz carrier.

318
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,450
So this is what we saw.

319
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,200
And you can see here that
there's funny stuff going on

320
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,560
in here because the tails
of the two replications

321
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,750
are merging with each other, OK?

322
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,150
So it's not perfectly
symmetrical around here.

323
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,210
And actually, these sinc-like
functions decay very slowly,

324
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,840
so even though it won't
be visible to your eye,

325
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,150
there's a considerable
amount of this

326
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,260
that's actually due to
the replica out here, OK?

327
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,030
So this case doesn't
quite satisfy

328
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,820
that band-limited condition.

329
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,620
If you shape your
pulse a little bit more

330
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,530
carefully, for instance, if
you had more rounded edges,

331
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,140
then you can pull in
the frequency content,

332
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,359
and you might do a
better approximation

333
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,210
to keeping the replica separate.

334
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,640
Or you might use a
higher carrier frequency.

335
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,430
That pull them apart and
have less interference,

336
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,650
but it's certainly an issue
that you need to think about.

337
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,560
OK.

338
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,670
So what happens at the receiver?

339
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,770
We already saw this briefly
at the end of lecture.

340
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,870
If what you receive is what
you transmit-- in other words,

341
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,020
if it's the signal, then
extracting the x of n is easy.

342
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,520
We said what you
do is you basically

343
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,400
do the same heterodyning
again, right?

344
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,260
You take the signal
that comes in,

345
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,890
multiply it by cosine of
the carrier frequency.

346
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,460
That's your signal
after demodulation,

347
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,240
and a little bit of algebra
shows that you actually

348
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,040
have your original
signal of interest,

349
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,300
and then something that's
your original signal

350
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,473
modulated by a cosine at
twice the carrier frequency.

351
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,390
So now there's some hope
that you can actually

352
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,500
pull these things apart.

353
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,400
All right.

354
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,440
So one question,
of course, is what

355
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,180
does the spectrum of this look
like, and we'll look at that.

356
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,020
And then the other
question is, again,

357
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,990
what constraint on the
bandwidth of the signal

358
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,980
that you originally sent
from the transmitter--

359
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,260
what constraint is
needed to recover?

360
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:36,040
So let's look at the spectrum
of the received signal first.

361
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,560
We're assuming the
channel is not distorting

362
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,110
and that we don't have
noise, so what's transmitted

363
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,950
is also what's received.

364
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,830
So here is the spectrum
of what's received.

365
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,290
It's exactly the spectrum I
showed you earlier, right?

366
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,340
It was the baseband spectrum,
but replicated at plus omega c

367
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,510
and minus omega c.

368
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,030
So this is what comes
in off the channel,

369
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,520
assuming no distortion.

370
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,020
And I'm going to
multiply it again

371
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,220
by a cosine at the
carrier frequency.

372
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,890
So what is it that I have to do?

373
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,710
I take this entire
spectrum, plunk down

374
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,740
a copy centered at plus
omega c, and another copy

375
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,880
at minus omega c.

376
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,600
Because my demodulation,
just to remind you,

377
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,570
my demodulation
is multiplication

378
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,850
by cosine omega c again.

379
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,860
It's a multiplication
by cosine omega c.

380
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,990
Well, we know what that does
in the transform domain, so

381
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,840
here is the picture.

382
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,750
And the piece that we
want is the center piece.

383
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,150
So what we need to
do is filter it out

384
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,990
of what's resulted
from the heterodyning.

385
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,750
So what kind of cutoff frequency
would you-- what kind of filter

386
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,510
and what kind of cutoff
frequency would you want?

387
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,025
Any suggestions?

388
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,862
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

389
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:55,320
GEORGE VERGHESE: Sorry, I didn't
hear where that came from.

390
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,938
Yeah?

391
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:56,980
AUDIENCE: Lowpass filter?

392
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
GEORGE VERGHESE: Lowpass filter.

393
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,830
So, for instance, an
ideal lowpass filter

394
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,760
would be great, right?

395
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:08,870
If you had a filter with a
frequency-domain characteristic

396
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:14,550
that was perfectly flat in
some region and then cut off,

397
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,147
let me say, at some
frequency omega 0,

398
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:19,730
so something like that-- well,
actually, we want a factor of 2

399
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,920
to compensate for the
demodulation process,

400
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,332
if we want to get exactly
the same thing back.

401
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:31,040
So this would be in
the frequency domain.

402
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,300
Ideal lowpass filter.

403
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,580
And we know how to get
approximations to this, right?

404
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,490
Because this is not
really implementable.

405
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,950
If you wanted to implement
this, what kind of unit sample

406
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,680
response would you need?

407
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,840
A sinc function, right,
but extending infinitely

408
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,170
in both directions.

409
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,070
But we could truncate that
sinc, and we could shift it

410
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,330
forwards in time to get a causal
approximation to this filter.

411
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,160
And the resulting
frequency response

412
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,670
will, if you plot it out, if
you compute it and plot it,

413
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,860
won't look too
different from this.

414
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,800
If I plotted the
magnitude, you'll

415
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,550
get-- it's something that's
a plausible approximation

416
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,580
to this lowpass filter.

417
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,400
But what cutoff
frequency would you want?

418
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,150
What omega 0 should you pick?

419
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,096
Any suggestions?

420
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,280
Anybody?

421
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,780
We're trying to
extract this piece.

422
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,960
So omega c would be a
pretty safe choice, right?

423
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,760
Omega c would be one that passed
everything here, and would

424
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,920
basically extract
any signal that

425
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,320
satisfied that initial
constraint that we mentioned.

426
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,420
So if your baseband
signal originally

427
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,110
extended from minus
omega c to plus omega c,

428
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,430
then a lowpass
filter that extracted

429
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,810
that would do fine
without pulling

430
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,570
in any of the replication here.

431
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,720
So omega c is certainly fine.

432
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,390
But if the signal that you
transmitted at baseband

433
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,780
actually had a narrower
bandwidth than that,

434
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,140
then you might just
want to get away

435
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,902
with a lowpass filter
with a lower cutoff.

436
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:28,860
Can you think of why you
might want to do that?

437
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,340
Is there anything
that motivates you

438
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,530
to use as small a
bandwidth as possible?

439
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,315
Yeah?

440
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,962
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

441
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:41,170
GEORGE VERGHESE: To limit
the amount of noise, right?

442
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,560
We suppress noise
in this whole story.

443
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,910
So if you're going to
build a filter like this

444
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,400
but all the interesting
action is over here,

445
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,090
well, all of the
rest of the filter

446
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,670
is doing is letting other
signals get in, especially

447
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,830
noise, and then that's
going to add to the output

448
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,110
and make things more
difficult. So you'd really

449
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,810
like to get the
smallest bandwidth that

450
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,740
suffices to pass the signal part
of what you're interested in

451
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,750
but keep out the
noise, all right?

452
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,030
But if you didn't know
anything about the signal

453
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,300
and its spread, or you believe
that the spectrum extended

454
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,030
really from minus omega
c to plus omega c,

455
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,270
then you would want to
make omega not equal

456
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,900
to the carrier frequency, right?

457
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,050
But you've got to look at
your particular situation

458
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,250
and see what it is
you're going to do.

459
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:37,140
OK, so this is the picture
that we have at demodulation.

460
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,080
You're going to take the
received-- well, no, sorry.

461
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
This is the modulation part.

462
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,230
Ah, no, it's not.

463
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,580
Sorry, this is not well-drawn.

464
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,720
That shouldn't be x sub n.

465
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,370
That should be the
received signal, OK?

466
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,610
So the received signal comes
in, gets multiplied locally

467
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,448
by cosine, gives you
the demodulated signal,

468
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:56,990
and then you have
the lowpass filter,

469
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,015
so I'll change that
before I post it.

470
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,650
Simple enough?

471
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,220
OK.

472
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,480
Now, there are some problems
that you can run into,

473
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,210
and doing all of this in the
lab you actually see that

474
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:15,970
very quickly.

475
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,140
So let me actually put
this on the board here.

476
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,160
What we said is that our
demodulated signal is

477
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:39,380
going to be our received signal
times cosine omega c n, right?

478
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,560
And if we assume no distortion
in the channel this,

479
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,730
is x n cosine omega c n.

480
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,970
But there's a bit
of a problem here,

481
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,750
which is that,
even if you've been

482
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,260
told what carrier frequency
your center is going to use,

483
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,843
you might not know
exactly what phase.

484
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:00,843
It's typically the case
that you don't know what

485
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:02,150
the phase is on this cosine.

486
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,190
So you know omega c, but you
don't know exactly the phase,

487
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,120
which means that your local
carrier, your local oscillator

488
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,930
or your local carrier
multiplication here,

489
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,640
will end up having some offset
relative to the carrier used

490
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,500
at the transmitting end, OK?

491
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,650
And so the question is,
if we track this through,

492
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,380
what happens through the
demodulation process,

493
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,090
so that's really what
this is trying to do.

494
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,780
So we're saying d of n
is your received signal,

495
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,240
but the local oscillator or
the local cosine that you're

496
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,370
heterodyning with
at the receiver

497
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,870
doesn't know exactly what phase
was used as the transmitter,

498
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,610
so you've got to
assume that there

499
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,130
is going to be some offset.

500
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,000
So this is actually what
the multiplication is.

501
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,640
And now you use a
simple trig identity.

502
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,540
It's the cosine of something
times the cosine of something.

503
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,710
That splits into this.

504
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,440
And so what we're actually going
to get from the heterodyning

505
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,780
at the receiver is x of
n times all of this, OK?

506
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,923
So what we're going to get is--

507
00:26:21,923 --> 00:26:23,090
I should write it down here.

508
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,750
We're going to get 0.5 x of n.

509
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,430
And then there's
two pieces here.

510
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,090
There is the cosine
phi, and then there

511
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,550
is the cosine 2
omega c n minus phi.

512
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,730
OK?

513
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,230
When you don't have
any phase error,

514
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:55,010
the cosine phi term is 1, but
now it's reduced from that.

515
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,700
The rest of the
process is the same.

516
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,210
You're going to do some
filtering to get rid

517
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,660
of this piece, the
double frequency piece,

518
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,270
and you're going to pull out
just what you're interested in.

519
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,840
Except now it's no
longer x of n itself.

520
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,500
It's x of n multiplied
by this cosine.

521
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,200
So can you see that this
could lead you into trouble?

522
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,410
What's the worst case here?

523
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,020
Sorry, worst case-- yeah?

524
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

525
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,260
GEORGE VERGHESE: Yeah,
if phi is pi over 2,

526
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,680
then cosine phi is 0, and
you get nothing, all right?

527
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,810
So if you're unlucky
in the offset

528
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,960
between your local sinusoid
and the sinusoid that

529
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,840
was used at the transmitter, you
could end up with nothing, OK?

530
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,490
You can also get
the negative of what

531
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,470
was sent, and so
on, so you can go

532
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,930
through the whole set
of possibilities there.

533
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:59,420
So the case of a phase
error of pi over 2

534
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,060
corresponds to looking
at a signal that

535
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,670
was transmitted on a cosine and
multiplying it by a sine, OK?

536
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,920
And you can think through
that in the spectral setting,

537
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,420
as well.

538
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,212
Maybe you'll do some
of this in recitation,

539
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:15,080
or maybe you already have.

540
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,680
But when you multiply by a
sine in the spectral domain--

541
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,780
So if you've got--

542
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,460
you've got your
received signal, r of n,

543
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,880
and now you're multiplying
it by sine omega c n, right?

544
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:48,330
Sine omega c n, well, that's
1 over 2j e to the j omega

545
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:56,370
c n minus e to the minus
j omega c n, right?

546
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,730
So in the spectral
domain, what happens?

547
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,650
Well, you've got r of n
multiplied by 1 over 2j times

548
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,090
this first exponential.

549
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,520
In the spectral domain,
that does a shifting

550
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,270
and a multiplying by 1
over 2j, and then you've

551
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,320
got this term doing
the same kind of thing.

552
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,460
So you're going to have a
shift of the spectrum of r of n

553
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,250
in the frequency domain
and a scaling by 1 over 2j.

554
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,120
So if you think through what
the shifting and scaling does,

555
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,590
you see that it's
a little bit more

556
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,040
of a complicated picture
of what you had over here.

557
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,050
Well, the real part gets
replicated around the 2 omega c

558
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,970
region, but flipped over.

559
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,760
The imaginary part gets
carried over intact.

560
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,550
And then the replications
around minus 2-- sorry,

561
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,270
around minus omega c, that is--

562
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,390
the imaginary part
gets flipped over,

563
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,060
and the real part gets
carried over directly.

564
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,580
Except what was real before
becomes imaginary now.

565
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,978
What was imaginary
before becomes real now.

566
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:57,520
So you can track
through all of that.

567
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
And it just comes from applying
the standard DTFT results

568
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,910
to what the spectrum of the
product of an r of n and this

569
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,560
is, OK?

570
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,940
But the interesting
thing is now,

571
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,180
the two replications,
when you sum them up,

572
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,740
will leave you with nothing
at 0 because this piece here

573
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,692
will cancel out exactly
with that piece there.

574
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,900
So if you think through in
the spectral domain what's

575
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,460
going on, you'll
understand exactly

576
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,580
that if you've put your
signal on the cosine

577
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,350
and you demodulate
with a sign, you're

578
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,350
going to get nothing in
that lowpass region, OK?

579
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,980
So that's just the same
result but seen spectrally.

580
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,640
All right, so that's
uncertainty between the phase

581
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,490
of the transmitter and
the phase of the receiver.

582
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,460
Here's another thing that
has a similar effect, which

583
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,530
is an unknown delay
on the channel, OK?

584
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,120
So at the transmitting end,
you've got your baseband signal

585
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,470
multiplying the carrier.

586
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,942
This is what's transmitted.

587
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:00,650
But then you have a
time delay, let's say

588
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,070
D samples, capital D samples.

589
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,840
So then what's received is
actually t of n minus D,

590
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,940
and that's what's
going to get multiplied

591
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,022
by the local carrier.

592
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,480
And I'm assuming for now that
you have the phase, so we can

593
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,220
bring them both together later.

594
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,650
But I'm assuming now there's
no phase out locally,

595
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,297
but there's an unknown
delay on the channel.

596
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,630
And you can see it's going
to be the same kind of thing.

597
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,670
You've got a cosine
times a cosine,

598
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,190
and the arguments are slightly
different from each other.

599
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,680
And you use the
same trig identity,

600
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,160
and what you find is the
output of this process

601
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,260
is not the input
delayed, which is what

602
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,670
you would like to get ideally.

603
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,160
You aren't going to
compensate for the delay

604
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,210
with a causal filter, but
it's also going to be scaled.

605
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,910
And it's going to be scaled by
an unknown amount that depends

606
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,967
on that delay, all right?

607
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,800
So it's the same kind
of thing that happens.

608
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,400
So the question is, how
do we get around this?

609
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,010
And here's one idea
that works well,

610
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,160
and which you're actually
exploring in the lab.

611
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,890
Which is to use both the
sine and the cosine, OK?

612
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,060
So use both the sign on
the cosine to demodulate.

613
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,685
If you go completely
bad on one channel

614
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,560
because you've got the
phase completely wrong

615
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,980
with the cosine,
you're going to do

616
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,107
all right on the sine channel.

617
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,940
If you do completely
bad on the sine channel

618
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,270
because you've got
the phase wrong,

619
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,603
then you're going to do all
right on the cosine channel.

620
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:29,130
So at least one
of them will work,

621
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,340
and more typically both of
them will work a little bit,

622
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,360
and what you'll then do is
combine the two outputs.

623
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,860
OK?

624
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,000
So you're going to have
the signal coming in.

625
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,860
There's a cosine multiplication
and the sine multiplication,

626
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,510
and then the lowpass filtering.

627
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,530
We refer to this as
the in-phase component,

628
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,240
assuming that you were
modulating on a cosine,

629
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,630
and this is referred to as
the quadrature component.

630
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,390
So there's in-phase
and quadrature.

631
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,070
"Quadrature" just
means at right angles.

632
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,100
So this is the I and
the Q components.

633
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,030
And if you work out what
these are, assuming now

634
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,450
that there's both a time
delay and a phase offset,

635
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,470
you can see that the
in-phase component

636
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,470
will be the signal that
you want, but multiplied

637
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,978
by cosine phi.

638
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,770
The quadrature component
will be the signal

639
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,020
that you want, but
multiplied by sine phi.

640
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,460
And from there, it's
not so hard to imagine

641
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,200
that you could actually get
back to the signal of interest.

642
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,240
And here's one way to
do it that works fine

643
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,730
if you've got on-off signaling.

644
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,560
So what you would do is,
here's the I. Here's the Q.

645
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,670
And I've just represented
it graphically here.

646
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,900
This is typical to do.

647
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,250
So here is the I component.

648
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,520
Here is the Q component.

649
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,850
And you could take the
root sum of squares

650
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,730
to basically get rid of that
sine theta and cosine theta

651
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,810
term, right?

652
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,900
So what that's going to give
you is the absolute value of x

653
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,020
of n minus D. So you
can certainly get back

654
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,210
the absolute value of what was
used to modulate the carrier,

655
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,440
and that may be all you need.

656
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,523
If you have on-off signaling,
that's all you need.

657
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:27,170
If your modulating signal
never goes negative,

658
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,110
its absolute value is the same
as the signal, so this is fine.

659
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:36,830
So what you will discover is
that you get some signal out

660
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,810
there, and you're
looking for its length.

661
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,710
When the length is non-zero,
you say you have a 1 cent.

662
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,800
When the length of 0, you
say you have a 0 cent.

663
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,590
In the presence of
noise, of course,

664
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,540
it won't be exactly
at the origin.

665
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,429
There might be some
cloud of points there.

666
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,760
And similarly for the 1 level.

667
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,370
What if you were interested
in the polarity, though?

668
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,800
So suppose it mattered to
you whether the signal was

669
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,780
positive or negative.

670
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,700
Well, you could then
just plot the point

671
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,017
and don't take the magnitude.

672
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:17,350
So you'll get something that
looks a bit more like this.

673
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,120
OK?

674
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,270
So what you'll have
is, when a 1 is sent,

675
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,050
perhaps you'll get that value
in the absence of noise.

676
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,790
When a minus 1 is
sent-- sorry, when

677
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:34,022
a 0 is sent,
corresponding to minus 1,

678
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:34,980
this is what you'd get.

679
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,688
This is-- sorry, I
should have said that.

680
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:38,550
This is assuming bipolar
signaling, right?

681
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,290
Bipolar signaling
is the case where

682
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,530
you're interested in
the sign of the signal.

683
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,600
You use plus 1 to send a 1.

684
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,780
You use minus 1 to send a 0, OK?

685
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,290
So you get some
diagram like this.

686
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,810
The only problem here is, if
you've got uncertain phase

687
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,290
and delay, you actually don't
know which of these two points

688
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,150
corresponds to the
plus 1 and which

689
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,250
corresponds to the minus 1.

690
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,930
So there's that
additional ambiguity

691
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,160
that needs to
somehow be resolved,

692
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,450
and there are different
procedures you might use.

693
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,520
You could, for instance,
have some preamble

694
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,210
with a sign that's agreed
on and use that as a basis

695
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,120
for figuring out which is a
plus and which is a minus.

696
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,690
And there are other ways of
doing it, as well, where what's

697
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,200
called differential coding,
where basically it's

698
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,960
not where that is, but
whether it flips over

699
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,640
to the other side or
not that signals a bit.

700
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,230
And so what you could
do is, to transmit a 1,

701
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,440
you'll step the phase by pi,
and that can be detected,

702
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,210
and to transmit a
0, you don't change

703
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,100
the phase in the next bit slot.

704
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,030
So if from one bit slot to
the next the dot stays there,

705
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,460
you know you've
just received a 0.

706
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,410
If from one bit
slot to the next it

707
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,935
flips over to the
other side, you

708
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:53,220
know you've just
received a 1, OK?

709
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,770
So even with the ambiguity,
if you change the way you

710
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,790
code at the sending end, you can
actually compensate for this.

711
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,330
OK, now playing this game
with sines and cosines

712
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,850
can actually also be done
at the transmitting end,

713
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,090
and we haven't
explored that in class,

714
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,550
but it's something that
you could think about.

715
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,430
So we've been talking
about taking the samples

716
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,910
and multiplying them
onto a cosine carrier.

717
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,030
You could have another
bitstream whose samples you

718
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,410
multiply onto a sine carrier.

719
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,410
And you can just add them
together and send them

720
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,820
over the channel.

721
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,870
At the receiving end,
you multiply by cosine.

722
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,390
Well, that'll only pull out--
you multiply that cosine

723
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,550
and then filter,
lowpass filter--

724
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,450
that'll only pull out the
first stream in the ideal case.

725
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,640
Multiply by a sine
and filter, you'll

726
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,990
get exactly the second stream.

727
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,930
So you can simultaneously
send two streams

728
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:55,990
on a given carrier using
this scheme, this method, OK?

729
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,850
So depending on how you make out
in the lab in problem set 6--

730
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,190
I don't know how many
simultaneous carriers

731
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,250
you're getting, but
whatever you end up with you

732
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,150
can actually try now to transmit
twice as much on each carrier

733
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,760
by using this kind of a scheme.

734
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,710
Could be fun.

735
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,700
All right, so this kind
of bipolar signaling,

736
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
what's called
phase-shift keying--

737
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,913
I didn't explain
that really, did I?

738
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:29,270
I said-- we've said
it before, but--

739
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,940
we've talked about bipolar
or phase-shift keying.

740
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:48,550
All that we mean is, if you get
a signal with voltage plus 1

741
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,990
and minus 1 for
your bit 0 on bit 1,

742
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,540
by the time you modulate what
you're going to end up doing

743
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:01,795
is sending a burst of
carrier here with the plus 1.

744
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,670
And then when you come
to the minus 1 region,

745
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,712
you're going to multiply
that carrier by minus 1,

746
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:09,790
so you're going to suddenly
step the phase, right?

747
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,660
So amplitude modulation
with an amplifier

748
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,840
that switches
between these levels

749
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,410
can be also thought of
as a phase shifting.

750
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,930
So you're keying between
a phase of 0 degrees

751
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,620
and a phase of 180.

752
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,470
So this kind of scheme is
used all over the place.

753
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:38,030
And I actually have a slide that
lists a whole bunch of schemes

754
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,280
that you're familiar
with, you see every day

755
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,560
in all sorts of literature.

756
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,363
You know, 802, and Bluetooth,
and Zigbee and so on.

757
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:47,780
In all of these
standards, there's

758
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,690
some piece of it or some
domain or some regime

759
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,390
in which what's going on
is some variant of what

760
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,520
we've learned here.

761
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,870
And they get fancier
and more sophisticated,

762
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:00,200
but you really have
the key ideas here.

763
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,820
OK, let's now talk about putting
multiple signals on a given

764
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,760
piece of the spectrum, OK?

765
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,090
This is exactly the situation
you have in your lab now.

766
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,210
You've got the speaker that
can transmit in a certain band,

767
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,990
and you're trying to put
multiple simultaneous signals

768
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,800
on it by using
different carriers.

769
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,160
So this is what's called
Frequency-Division

770
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,140
Multiplexing, or FDM.

771
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,830
And the idea is very simple.

772
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,690
You've got three signals
here and this illustration,

773
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,210
the blue signal, red, and green.

774
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,620
Pick a carrier frequency
for each of them.

775
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,430
Do the modulation, and then
just add them on the channel.

776
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,910
If you've got a linear
medium, then the signals

777
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,640
will superpose,
so what's received

778
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,580
is just the sum
of these, and now

779
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,720
you can do the
same kind of thing.

780
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,610
And what we're relying
on here is, again,

781
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,830
the heterodyning principle.

782
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,715
Whoops, sorry.

783
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,740
OK, so if you've got frequencies
omega red, omega blue,

784
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,910
omega green in the signal
that you're receiving,

785
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:31,830
and you multiply this with some
local sinusoidal frequency,

786
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:37,010
omega 0, where will
your various spectra

787
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,870
be centered in the result?

788
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,810
So the way to think
of it is, all the sums

789
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,960
at different frequencies
here will now appear.

790
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,850
So you get omega 0 plus omega r.

791
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:57,410
You get omega 0 minus omega r,
and similarly for all of these.

792
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,560
OK, it's the same thing that you
saw with a single transmitted

793
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,740
the signal, except now it's a
more elaborate constellation.

794
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:12,540
It's actually this
that's being transmitted.

795
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:18,110
So the receiving end, you'll
pick a particular frequency

796
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,180
to multiply the
incoming signal by.

797
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,060
The result will have pieces
of the spectrum centered

798
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,380
at each of these.

799
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,850
So if you want to center one of
these in your lowpass filter,

800
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,800
how should you pick
the local oscillator?

801
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,760
If you want to
tune in a channel,

802
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,640
what is it that you want to do?

803
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,250
You want to get one of
these center frequencies

804
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,090
to sit right in the window
of your lowpass filter.

805
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,840
So what you'll end up doing
is pick your local oscillator

806
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,630
frequency to be the carrier
frequency of the station you're

807
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,930
interested in, or the signal
you're interested in, OK?

808
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,770
So it's the same idea.

809
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,380
You have a lowpass
filter, and you're

810
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,840
using heterodyning
to shift the piece

811
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,020
of the spectrum of
interest into the passband

812
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,130
of the lowpass filter.

813
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,630
All right?

814
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,740
Now, what about the bandwidth
of the lowpass filter?

815
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,520
What should it be?

816
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,720
So now it depends on how closely
spaced your carriers are,

817
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,220
right?

818
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,240
So for instance, if I
ended up heterodyning

819
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,650
such that my blue
signal, my blue signal

820
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,660
came into the
window of interest--

821
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,340
and I've got the red spectrum
sitting somewhere here

822
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,580
and the other piece
sitting somewhere here.

823
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,100
OK?

824
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,370
I've shifted things
so that this is at 0.

825
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,720
What's this frequency now?

826
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,370
Omega r minus omega--

827
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,480
what was it?

828
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,280
Blue, right?

829
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,230
So I've basically shifted
these frequencies.

830
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,560
So this is at 0, sitting
in my lowpass filter.

831
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,570
Use a different color.

832
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,530
And I want to reject
everything else.

833
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:26,340
So how should I pick
that lowpass filter?

834
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,140
Well, presumably,
you want the cutoff

835
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,350
to lie between these
two frequencies.

836
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,480
So you want half the distance
to the nearest carrier, right?

837
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,842
Half the distance to the
nearest carrier frequency.

838
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:42,950
OK, so you can
think through these.

839
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,593
And notice how all
our thinking has

840
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:45,760
been in the spectral domain.

841
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,670
Thinking in the frequency domain
clarifies this whole thing.

842
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,040
You really would not
have been able to do

843
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,570
what you're doing thinking
entirely in the time domain.

844
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,520
Now, all of this comes
to us, really, from--

845
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,600
let's see.

846
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,820
I had that already?

847
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,220
Yeah.

848
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,540
All of this comes to us from
a rich legacy in AM radio.

849
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,040
We're not using this for
transmission of analog signals

850
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,490
by amplitude modulation,
but it's the same principle.

851
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,920
So these principles
actually were studied

852
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,250
from the early 1900s, actually.

853
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,770
And the AM radio
that we see around us

854
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,357
now is actually set up exactly
to do the kind of thing

855
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:29,190
we're talking about.

856
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,440
So you've got some
frequency spectrum

857
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,380
that the FCC is
allowing you to use.

858
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,320
Different stations are given
different carrier frequencies

859
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,760
that they can operate on.

860
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,840
They're also instructed on
what bandwidth they can occupy.

861
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,860
So basically, the carriers
are 10 kilohertz apart,

862
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,185
the way that the
stations are assigned.

863
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,270
So if you're transmitting
from your station,

864
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,310
you'd better lowpass
filter what you're

865
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,213
sending out to 5 kilohertz
before you transmit it.

866
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:03,630
Because if you
don't, you're going

867
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,310
to interfere with
a nearby station.

868
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,200
Assuming there is a station in
the same geographic area that's

869
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,660
been assigned to a neighboring
carrier frequency, all right?

870
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,390
So all of these issues come in.

871
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,860
Another thing that actually is--

872
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,820
what did I do here?

873
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,390
I think I--

874
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,690
I mashed together two slides.

875
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,620
But the other thing that--

876
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,470
it turns out, for
instance, AM radio,

877
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,860
at nighttime, because of
the way radio transmits,

878
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,030
the signal can
propagate much further.

879
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,570
So these stations
are asked to reduce

880
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,047
their signal strength, the
carrier strength, at nighttime

881
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:48,255
so that they're not interfering
with nearby stations.

882
00:46:48,255 --> 00:46:50,005
The stations that they
would not interfere

883
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:52,650
with during the day they
could interfere with at night

884
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,260
because propagation
characteristics

885
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,440
turn out to change.

886
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,250
So all of this
business of your signal

887
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,740
not interfering with
your neighbor's carrier

888
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,500
or your neighbor's portion
of the spectrum, all of that

889
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,880
ends up being important.

890
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,060
OK, I think we've
probably said as

891
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,500
much as we want to say about
the signals part of this class.

892
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,640
One of the things about
602 is that those of you

893
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,622
who master it come out knowing
the subject better than any

894
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:22,830
of us that teach it because
there's none of us that's

895
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,948
able to teach the course
right through start to finish.

896
00:47:25,948 --> 00:47:27,240
Well, that's not entirely true.

897
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,870
Harry knows how to do it Chris
Terman knows how to do it.

898
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,705
The recitation instructors hang
in there for the whole term,

899
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:35,580
but it's very hard for
one person to do that.

900
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,180
So I'm done.

901
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,710
I'm going to be sitting
there from lecture onwards,

902
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,070
so thank you all for your
attention, and thank you.
